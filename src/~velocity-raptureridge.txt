Velocity Raptureridge is not an esteemed scholar of anything, really, but what she lacks in credentials she makes up for with enthusiasm and sometimes-terrifying passion for the legendary [[Sundering War]] period. She lives with her parents in a remote village of Belar and spends her days reading through every book in her local library and the traveling libraries that happen to visit. It is from one such traveling librarian that Velocity learned of this endeavor to compile a new comprehensive encyclopedia of the Belaran-Tedorfell union, and jumped at the chance to share her passion with a new audience.

Due to the remoteness of Velocity's village and singlemindedness of her focus, recent history may pass her by, but absolutely no one is more familiar with the (alleged) movements of the Cloudrift army against the Tedorans than Velocity. She's prepared to argue with you until you see her point of view.

She is also highly knowledgeable about the ballads and [[lyrical epic sagas]] written during and about the Sundering Wars, and is looking forward to sharing this information with her fellow encyclopedia compilers.
