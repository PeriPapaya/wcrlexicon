# Title: Aegil Tournament

The tournament might appear senseless to a foreigner who hasn’t fathomed Tedorfell, but any widely celebrated thing fulfills sociological use. And to perceive the tournament’s use, we have to perceive its history beyond familiarity’s veil. 

It was founded after the Tedorfellian empire has reached much of its current boundaries and the Barons convinced the Primaria to let Belar lie beyond the mountains, for conquest was becoming too costly. Still, peace discomfited them. Peace in which farmers and the [[Magi|Magi Circles]] struggled to gain influence, which they deemed at the cost of their prestige.

So they held a great bi-annual festival in [[Kol’Adarash]] to show off their fighting chops. (And chopping they did indeed.) They named it Aegil, after the [[Atakkran|Atakkra]] concept of War. 

From the start it attracted great success, becoming instantly a meeting point for the Tedorfellian elite which was almost entirely martial back then. They then had for the next edition the shrewd idea to make it public, which not only easied the Aegil’s financing, but also impressed in a literal sense many minds with war’s glory.
Thus the Barons inflated their status within the empire to heights even higher than during the conquering wars.

And here the original tournament’s use and significance is revealed to us. Its prestige like the pulse of the heart is intimately connected to the Barons’ martial prestige itself.

But all times change, and while it has flared up now and then – such as during renewed invasion attempts and border conflicts – war has decreased in popularity and many Barons have turned away from marital roles towards [[bureaucratic ones|The Baronical Electorate]]. Some of them even abandoning their border fort for a more efficient placement.

The fact is, the Barons have grown weary of war’s duty and divested themselves of it and added it to the expanding tasks of the Primaria, resulting in the [[Paladins and Zealous Pikes]]. 

Which altered the Tournament’s. No longer solely for the martial elite, participation has been made possible and even free for anyone wanting to enter, while the prize of winning increased with thousand lucres, turning it into a very popular free-for-all. 

One might wonder why the tournament still goes on with most of the Barons being no longer the warriors of earlier, it is because it has become a recruiting center where participants who perform well get the offer to join the Paladins or Zealous Pikes.

Thus shifted the tournament from being a focus for external directed state force to for internal. Given the origin of its name, what //is// the audience celebrating now when they watch it?

//Editor's Note: I'll tell you what they're celebrating--snacks, merch, and rooting for the hometown hero. There's nothing like going out to support your local brute at the Aegil with a hundred other whooping hooligans, a hotfrog in a bun in one hand and pennant with your team colors in the other. It's a source of national pride! I'm sure everyone reading this knows the Tedorfell's unofficial national anthem, "Take Me Out to the Maul Game" (which I definitely didn't learn on the trappistchord to boost the chances of my latest citizenship application.) ~Gorthan Frim//
