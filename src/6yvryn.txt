Oh this is just typical, just the greeting I should have expected from the so-called "neutral parties" running this project. Of course you Tedorfellian mulbiheads would dismiss Yvryn as "some remote village", not as if it is the birthplace of Belaran art or anything! Just the way we Belarans can expect to be treated from now on after the upcoming inva...sorry, "union"!

Anyways...

Yvryn is a border village in the north of Belar. Many Belaran artists got their start in Yvryn. Some say this is due to the refreshing mountain air, invigorating many a tired soul and inspiring one to gaze upon the majestic beauty that Natura bestows our lands and see it as if through new eyes, filling the heart with a desire to share this momentous feeling with one's fellow beings. Others say it's the duty-free alcohol. Having sampled both during my visit, I believe this matter warrants further research and intend to conduct further studies once my research grant gets approved.

When one visits Yvryn one is bound to notice how nearly every building has vibrant a mural of some kind. This is a result of perhaps the best known artistic movement to come out of Yvryn, indeed Belar as a whole: [[The Darkhearts]]. To have one's building touched by the masterstroke of a Darkheart is one of the greatest honours a Belaran could hope to achieve, and walking through the streets of Yvryn it is easy to see why.

In recent years, Yvryn has become the location of the Belar National Academy of Art. Established by the ninth [[Divlet of the High Elechon|Elechon]], the Academy receives much of the funding for artists in the kingdom, and the resulting proliferation of art speaks for itself. Ironically, the ivory walls of the School stand in stark contrast to the surrounding buildings, and it is rumoured that these walls are kept clean to satisfy the sensibilities of the Tedorfellians. I don't see why we should bother trying to reach out to them, there's no way to teach a Tedorfellian art, seeing as they've all got sticks up their...

I suppose that is another story, for another article.

//Editor's Note: Gah! Barti! I thought your return would help calm things down by balancing our Belar-Tedorfell split on the project, but if you're going to stir up mulbishit like praising the Darkhearts I'm banishing you to eulich mucking duty for the rest of the week. "Invasion"? The only thing getting invaded right now is my free time, editing your sensationalist articles. I expect an apology--preferably in the form of some of that duty free alcohol delivered to my office. ~Gorthan Frim//
