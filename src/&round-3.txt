Ladies, gentlemen, settle yourselves please! Is everyone here? Ah, right Dr. Grenada is taking the week off for his niece's birthday, how lovely. 

Let me see now... we have quite a spread of topics this week. It seems that Ser Caen and Lady Bartolomea are continuing to address the religious history of our nations, with Caen recounting the tumultous events of the [[Oathkill Heresy]] and Lady B offering an extensive--though incomplete--coverage of the [[Aestrian Pantheon]]. (I do not hold it against her, I've never met an Aestrian who could keep them all straight either.) Velocity is continuing her synopsis of ancient times with a passage on the uneventful [[Halcyon Era]], and Ratalan's contribution takes on a rather, ah, political topic surrounding the regulation of magical resources via [[The Writ of Limits]].

Unfortunately, lovely as this all is, we have a bit of a problem. It appears that //someone// thought it would be funny to slip a slanderously revolutionary article on the [[Primaria]] into my files this week and try to pass it off as a real submission to our codex--the nerve! Yes, Lady B, they do seem to be aligned with those noisome [[Darkheart revolutionaries|The Darkhearts]]. No, Miss Raptureridge, I do not know how it got on my desk! Though I can only assume that someone with insider access to this council must have slipped it in there...

I cannot impress upon you all enough how disastrous it would be if such //unfiltered// opinions where to make it to the published version of our work. It could perhaps even jeopardize the stability of the marriage agreement! As such, this week I would like to order a review of our written articles. Please review the instructions below, and report as soon as possible to me if you would like to author a redaction.

Remember--History is in our hands! Know the power words can hold and consider carefully how you will choose to wield it.

~Round 4 starts now! Articles are due Wednesday, June 15th.

Your assigned indices are: Masha (JKL), Vmunroe (MNO), Machina (PQRS), Desa (WXYZ), Psych (ABC), Kiki (DEF)

This week we are doing something a little different! You may choose to either write an article in your assigned index... or you may choose to write a redaction on an existing article! **Redactions must not factually contradict the original article**, but they can provide additional information, or recontextualize and question the given information. You are allowed to select articles from any index for a redaction, but you must "claim" that article in the discord so that none are double-picked. You may not write a redaction for a page that you wrote.
