**Gorthan Frim** is the chairperson of the illustrious panel of historians and leximages commissioned to author the joint history of Belarans and Tedorfell. They undertake this task with great reluctance, but thank the rulers of both countries for this generous opportunity to avoid being thrown in jail (again).

Frim has, at various times, claimed to have been born in various towns across Belarans and Tedorfell including Rellae, Penny's Hook, Grisht, Tintar, and the Isle of Sedgetera. Neither kingdom will grant them a birth certificate, as doing so would allow them to also claim citizenship, and nobody wants that. 

Frim began their career as a secret agent in [[Kol'adarash]], the Tedorfellian capitol. However it is unclear which country they were working for, as they promptly betrayed both in a maneuver described by some as "not exactly a quadruple-cross, more like a hyper-cube really" and "dastardly, but not in a cool way." Frim was arrested and jailed, but soon released as he agreed to work as a counter agent for Tedorfell. Upon crossing the border into Belarans, they were then arrested in that country as well. They soon cut a similar deal for their subsequent release, which they later also violated.

It is commonly said that Frim holds the record for the highest number of incarcerations in both countries; however, this is untrue, as there are accounts of a [[3rd century Tedorfellian ventriloquist|Epther the Shrill]] achieving a higher number in her home country. Frim's crimes include, but are not limited to, fraud, swindling, posing as a member of the clergy, espionage, counter-espionage, counter-counter-espionage, double-crossing, double-dealing, double-dipping, and insulting the personal hygiene of the High Echelon in public.

Many wonder how Frim ended up leading such a prestigious project as this. Rumor holds that the bi-national organizing committee were unable to agree on a chairperson from either Tedorfell or Belarans, fearing that doing so would introduce political bias into the resulting historical volumes. Frim's appointment was a compromise, as they are hated equally in both nations.

When asked for comment, Frim responded: "The bastards know this project is career suicide. I'm just glad they're letting me out of my cell for a few weeks."
