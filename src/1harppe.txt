Harppe is the God of Mystics, Farseers and Oracles in the [[Aestrian Pantheon]]. Like all Aestrian gods, Harppe is said to have been a legendary mortal before achieving godhood although like many of her peers, there is much doubt as to whether she ever truly lived. The era Harppe was meant to have lived in is unspecified by all official recountings but historical theorists generally agree that she would have existed around the nebulous [[Halcyon Era]], between the 400th and 700th year of our calendar. Stories tell that she lived in a kingdom called Getele, which does not appear in any other legends or historical records casting additional doubt upon any accuracy her legend may have. Scholars generally agree that if Getele did indeed exist, it would likely have been a part of what we now know as the Isle of Sedgetera.

    The legend of Harppe has her beginnings as a humble soothsayer who had visions of an invasion of Getele by a powerful kingdom of mainlanders. Realizing that even with forewarning her small kingdom lacked the strength to fight off the invasion, she dove deeper into augury, utilizing powerful and dangerous magics now lost to the ken of mortals. She foresaw that the war need end in the ultimate perishment of one of the sides so she undertook a quest to bring about the devastation of the enemy kingdom. At the end of her arduous and intricate quest, the invasion had already been launched but she was able to leverage political forces and arcane artifacts to decimate the kingdom of invaders. When they realized their leadership and supply lines were lost to them, the invaders pled clemency and joined Getele as a subservient class. Harppe was hailed as the greatest of heroes and ascended to godhood shortly after, gaining absolute mastery of augury in the process. The legend ends with her leaving behind numerous icons to be scattered to various locations and found only by pivotal individuals throughout history as part of a great plan of hers for the future of the world. 

    Harppe’s legend is unlikely and the legacy her myth engendered has been just as untrustworthy. Many have come forward claiming to trace ancestry back to her but this “blood of oracles” has been notoriously unreliable in truly improving a farseer’s sight or auger’s predictions. Furthermore, “Icons of Harppe” have been fabricated time and again by charlatans seeking the ear of those that hold true power. Such opportunistic pretenders have historically leveraged guesswork, psychology and coincidence to attain influence and more often than not brought about the ruination of those who have heeded them with untrustworthy and selfish advice. Regardless of the truth of Harppe’s legend, her name has been irrevocably tarnished by those who use it for easy credibility, even in the eyes of many Aestrians who often see her as unreliable in the modern era.

**REDACTION**

The original article is limited by a strictly Aestrian bastardization of Harppe’s life and legacy. As such it is hardly a surprise that it would seek to lower her holiness to a mere con artist like the braggarts and charlatans who compose the rest of the [[Aestrian Pantheon]]. 

Harppe is the 3rd known incarnation of the Bhram. She represents the aspects of prudence, temperance, and chastity. She is the patron incarnation of eight seminaries, fifty-three nunneries, thirty-three libraries and one-hundred and eighty-one orphanages. Her vision has led armies to victory against long odds at the battles of Ostafore and [[Vermillion Pass]].

The exact site of her birth and early life has been lost to time. However, myriad evidence exists of her travels along the islands and coast of the southern sea. Eighteen of the Atakkra texts and two of the secret Esakkra recall her travels in great detail. But even unbelievers must admit that the foundation of the region’s oldest temples all bear the eye and the ivy that is her mark. 

The icons that Harppe wisely scattered are no mere trinkets. They are intricate and unique relics formed of purest [[Zenthite]]. Their fine details display a level of precision and skill that our greatest masonocks have only recently begun to approach. As such forgeries are rather easily spotted. Furthermore, authentic Icons of Harppe have been found to possess harmonic properties that promote good fortune, keen eyesight, and excellent digestion when in the possession of pious believers.

//Editor's note: Ah, this would be a contentious topic, for Harppe appears as a protective figure in both faiths, though the Aestrains claim she was born mortal and elevated to godhood while the Atakkrans maintain that she was a divine reincarnation from the start. I am glad we have both perspectives now, for it demonstrates clearly to //me// a fundamental truth in this an all other matters: The more similar two things are, the more furiously they will make battle over it.\\
For practical advice on how to settle upset digestion, I would direct the reader to consult an herbology text rather than a mytho-religious one. ~Gorthan Frim//
