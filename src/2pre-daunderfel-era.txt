# Title: Pre-Daunderfel Era

The Pre-Daunderfel Era refers to a period of time that began sometime after the [[Legendary Epoch]] and directly preceded the rise of Autaleous Daunderfel and his [[Daunderfel Dynasty]] in a region covering [[Elskaer]], [[Cloudrift]], and the modern Tedorfell frontier. Little is known of the era save that the people who inhabited that land were known as the Botari, they were ruled by a council of 99, and they committed some sin or combination of sins so unbelievably wicked as to be wiped out almost completely in a mighty conflagration that consumed every historical record of the time.

It is unknown whether the holocaust that destroyed the Botari was an example of direct divine intervention or whether the Bhram used Autaleous Daunderfel as their holy instrument to remove the Botari and make room for the righteous followers of the one True Way.

Aside from a peculiar abundance of thatched sandals a single artifact remains from the Botari civilization. [[The Burnt Citadel of Illyacquus|Illyacquus, The Burnt Citadel of]] contains a 300 ft. obelisk forged of solid white kastone located on the Northern cliffs of [[Elskaer]]. The nature of its construction is a great mystery beyond the abilities of modern masons. However it was accomplished, the citadel has been granted immense resilience that rendered it near impervious to the calamity that consumed the rest of the Botari race. The one remaining mark is a thick black charcoal patina coating its bottom third which has persisted to this day despite a millennia of exposure to the elements.


//Editor's Note: Readers should note that the "divine intervention" mentioned above took the earthly form of several tons of highly-flammable Yolaish tar-fire launched by trebuchet, as well as a standing army of nearly 50,000, according to historical estimates. If the Aestrian gods are involved here, then they clearly favor intervention of a most //direct// sort. ~Gorthan Frim//
