# Title: King-Country Equation, The

As all places, history has its overlooked corners, yet out of which the dust and winds contribute to the house. And one of those corners who have paved the way to the marriage of our esteemed majesties was Esheria, one of world’s first secular political theorists.\\
Born in the 1780’s and in the developing Tedorfellian eastern seacity [[Graefel]] she grew up as beloved daughter of the city’s [[Primaria]], Canis Baeni. 
It might have been her gazing northwards at the visions raging through the Cloudrift, or her hearing the far-off thunder of armies marching on the Belarans, or perhaps her pity for her townspeople, but in any case she desired peace.

She studied the world and observed the relationship of the monarch to their country. Indeed, she posed King and Country were metaphysically One. And that if the ills of one side were hard to cure, treating the other side will subsequently heal the other.\\
This nonsense the palace-fed academics took to like leaking ships to buckets.\\
It did have good results. Such as the installation of a sewer system after a monarch suffered intermittent diarrhea. And the union of southern countries Vash and Fahel through their rulers’ marriage into Vashel.

However, problems arose when a royal child was born. Esheria insisted this necessitated a change in the country. Eventually a compromise was settled and Vashel committed to creating a great island close to [[Graefel]]: [[Grain]].\\
A consuming task! Which contributed to tensions, which collapsed the Union into civil war. To this day, Grain never got its planned size, but nevertheless managed to grow multiple city-states. And one of them, Absom, birthed the great diplomat, [[Sakai| Sakai Lain]], the chief architect of the upcoming marriage. 

Which just goes to show the unpredictability of the world.

//Editor's Note: The connection from creation of Grain to the birth of Absom hundreds of years later seems tenuous at best, but it's exactly the sort of pleasant mullbishit the High Echelon and the Primaria hired us for. Good work. ~Gorthan Frim//
