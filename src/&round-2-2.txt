Listen up, everyone! I hereby call to order the 3rd Meeting of they... yada yada you guys know the drill by now. Go ahead and grab a brambleberry bun and sit down. And be sure to thank Velocity for the snacks, I'll definitely be assigning you more articles on local food specialties, young lady.

Let's see what we've got this week... ah yes, I'm rather impressed, we seem to have filled in several gaps this week. Ser Brius and Dr. Grenada have both followed up Lady Bartolomea's detailed chapter on the [[Sundering War]] with further information about the [[Oath of the Summer Queen]] and her successor, [[Lyreon I]], which rounds out that subject rather nicely. 

Miss Raptureridge and Ratalan have both taken an interest in the [[Pre-Daunderfel Era]] and its importance in the region of [[Elskaer]]... oh dear. Ratalan, my good fellow, I know I said accuracy was optional but you must make at least a //passing// attempt. I daresay we will need some, ah, carefully worded corrections for whomever decides to tackle the chapter covering [[The Burnt Citadel of Illyacquus| Illyacquus, The Burnt Citadel of]].

Finally, we have Lady Bartolomea bravely expanding our work into the realm of economics and material history with her lucid and thorough coverage of [[Zenthite]]. Excellent work as always, Madame. I daresay this will form an excellent bridge into future discussions of the atrocities of the [[Daunderfel Era|Dauderfel Dynasty]]--though perhaps phrase it a bit more nicely than that.

By the way, has anyone seen Barti? He hasn't stopped by my office for //weeks//, and I keep having to explain to the High Echelon why we're a few chapters short. If you see him, tell him that he's making my life difficult. Now give me that last brambleberry bun, I'm going to eat it passive-agressively in his general direction.
