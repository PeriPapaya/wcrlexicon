Graefel, which roughly translates to "hidden berth" in Old Tedorfellian, is a seaport city on the southern coast of Tedorfell, southwest of [[Kol'adarash]] and northeast of [[Grain]]. It is a major juncture of trade between east and west, as well as the primary juncture where the [[Yelda Arch]] trade route connects to various overseas shipping lanes. 

Graefel is known for many things, including being the city without a skyline. From a distance, the unlearned observer may not even realize that one of the most bustling population centers on the continent lies before them. This is because the entirety of Graefel lies within a massive basin, almost a mile deep at its lowest point.

On its western side, the basin is open to the sea--or it would be, were it not for the massive ocean gates, one of the grandest [[World Engineering Works]] of our age. When the gates are closed, the city is closed off to the sea and its streets are bone dry. When the gates are opened, the waters rush in and flood the entire basin.

This, however, is little cause for alarm, as the entire city is engineered to function regardless of its current state of flooding. Important fixtures, such as the governor's palace and the Merchants' Guildhall, are built into the basin itself and are built so watertight that not a single drop makes its way inside. Smaller buildings, such as residences and storefronts, are built to float on top of the water's surface, slowly bobbing up to the top of the basin as the waters rise. Parts of the city streets themselves are also buoyant, allowing pedestrians to go about their business with little to no inconvenience. 

Current schedules have the city flooded three times a day, which is when merchant vessels enter the city to offload their cargo, and then set off again when the water is drained. The water level is strictly regulated and controlled by a series of locks that maintain a steady rate of water flow when the gates are open, and drain quickly when the gates are closed. 

This elaborate system serves an additional purpose, as it has proven to be a potent method of defense for the city. Should a naval assault occur, Graefel can simply drain the waters and instantly beach the entire enemy fleet. Should invaders attack by land, the defenders can simply flood the city and drown the hordes. It is a proven tactic, as Graefel has always remained untouched in every conflict Tedorfell has faced.

The city is a feat of engineering that is of mind-boggling complexity, yet the process in action is poetic in its practiced simplicty. One can easily identify tourists to the city by the open-jawed looks on their faces as they stop to watch entire neighborhoods rise up on the tide, while Graefel natives simply smile and click their tongues at these so-called "overlanders."

//Editor's Note: Though less lauded, Graefel is also notorious for being the site of one of the most impressive heists in Tedorfellian history. Allegedly, a motley crew of a dozen thieves robbed the home branch of the banking behemouth, The Tedorbellagio, using an ingenious mixture of deception, [[zenthite|Zenthite]] hackmagery, state of of the art diving equipment, and exquisitely timed use of the city's flood schedules. To this day, the real identity of their ringleader is mysterious, and they are known only by their supposed code name. The story was popularly dramatized for stage in the operetta "Ocean and the Eleven". ~Gorthan Frim//
