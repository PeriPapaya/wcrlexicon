# Title: The Writ of Limits

In the summer of 3387 Primaria Fotess Axon put down an attempted coup by a cabal of lay magicians. In response, Fotess moved decisively to curtail the organization of so-called free magi by issuing The Writ of Limitation on the Collective Activity of Wytchzards (colloquially known as the Writ of Limits). This law established harsh restrictions on communication and collaboration between magic artisans outside of liturgical settings.

Initially, the writ forbade any direct communication between magic artisans. Over time the rule was relaxed and magicians were allowed to form small non-hierarchical associations, under close observance by church censors and informants. These organizations would come to be known as [[Magi Circles]]. To this day the writ continues to evolve, new denominations of lay mage (including sympomages and masonocks) have been approved, and under certain conditions, circles may even apply for limited quantities of the holy stone, [[Zenthite]]. 

The Writ of Limits has made Tedorfell’s magic industry is the envy of the world. However, claims of decadence and eastern influence within the holy ee have led some to question whether it is time to place the responsibility for enforcement of the writ in new hands.

With the pending union between the kingdoms of Tedorfell and Belar, the Writ of Limits must now be reconciled with Belaran’s much more liberal magic policies. It will be up to [[Lady Bethiria Reynear|Bethiria Reynear]] and her litigaunts to argue for the writ’s continued necessity in the kingdom to come. May Bhram guide her.
