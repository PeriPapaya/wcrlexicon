Zenthite is an incredibly rare metal that is prized across the continent for its many unique properties in blacksmithing, architecture, and spellcraft.

While its existence was presumably known earlier (there are records of "a luminous white iron, smooth as glass to the touch yet impenetrable to even the sharpest pick" dating back almost five thousand years), zenthite was not widely studied until the [[Daunderfel Era|Daunderfel Dynasty]], when advances in geomancy allowed for the substance to be mined in large quantities for the first time.

In addition to being one of the hardest substances found terrestrially, zenthite also has an abnormally high melting point, making it difficult to use for metalworking but incredibly durable when refined. Even more intriguing are its magical applications; zenthite is the most effective conduit for magical energies currently known. Arcane scholars theorize that zenthite possesses the same natural "resonance" as magic, allowing it to channel and direct spells with no loss in potency. Thus, zenthite has seen great demand from many [[Magi Circles]]: zenthite nibs for the quills of leximages, zenthite staves for symphomage conductors, and other such innovations have allowed for greater achievements in the practice of magic than ever seen before. Weapons made of zenthite are also highly prized, particularly among the warrior clans of Belar, who believe that such weapons are capable of devouring the very souls of those they cut down.

Veins of zenthite have been found in several places, but its greatest abundance in recent years has been in [[Grain]] (some hypothesize that the island was created in a fortuitous location, others that the magical creation of the island somehow induced a supply of the substance into being). That the main supply of zenthite is under [[Tedorfell]] control has been no small bone of contention in its relations with Belar.
