Elskaer is a province in Belar best known for being the site of [[The Burnt Citadel of Illyacquus| Illyacquus, The Burnt Citadel of]] from the [[Pre-Daunderfel Era]]. Elskaer was under Tedorfellian occupation until several years ago, although now that the kingdoms are uniting the question of ownership over Elskaer is unimportant. It is close to the Belar-Tedorfell border, towards the north.

Ever since the question of the footprints in Illyacquus was resolved thanks to the efforts of [[Bartifellous Barti|~Bartifellous Barti]], the site has been a tourist hotspot, selling thatched-sole shoes and matches to curious visitors from across Belar and Tedorfell. 

The Belaran Traveling Library network is based out of Elskaer, disseminating books and knowledge around the villages of the country. Due to the recent conflicts and conquests, Elskaer has a highly developed ground transportation network.

Brambleberry buns are an Elskaerian specialty, as brambleberry bushes grow well in ashy soil. The buns can be found in any Elskaerian bakery and taste best with clotted cream. They are this editor's favorite. 

//Editor's Note: Well done, Miss Raptureridge, this is a clear and concise coverage of the topic at hand. However, I question whether the serving suggestions of brambleberry buns are significant enough for inclusion in a millenium-spanning history--perhaps you could bring some to the next meeting and we can judge for ourselves? ~Gorthan Frim//
