Kol’adarash
Capital of the Tedofell government and the Holy Ee of the Atakkran faith. The hero/warlord [[Lyreon I]] founded Kol’adarash as a citadel during the waning years of the [[Sundering War]]. He named it after his aunt and mentor Kol’adar. 

Kol’adarash’s proximity to power made it an attractive home to the most prestigious noble families of Tedorfell, the majority of which now call the city their home. Likewise, the city’s proximity to the [[Vermillion Pass]] has made it Tedorfell’s second largest trade hub and its “Door to the Orient”. This prosperity has also made the city home to numerous smuggling rings. Many of which exist solely to bypass Tedorfell’s notoriously onerous duty on non-ritual alcohol.

The city’s location has made it the ideal location for Tedorfell’s favorite sport and display of martial prowess; the [[Aegil Tournament]]. Tedorfell’s mightiest warriors battling so near the border of Belar has served as a powerful warning to our dear neighbors to the East how essential it is for their own well-being that they remain neighborly.

Kol’adarashi artistic compositions have been said to combine the wit and grace of Tedorfell with Belar’s fire. From all over the world artists and craftspeople come to Kol’adarash in hopes that they will become among its luminaries,the greatest [[Writers and Poets of Our Era]]. However, it’s not all songs and sonnets. Rivalries between the city’s theatrical community and upstart leximage transcriptavists has lead to a series of libracafe brawls over the ideal method of adapting [[The King Clad in Winter]]. Most of which were started by the transcriptavists, who subsequently lost.

It pains this servant of Bhram that this article cannot end here. For unfortunately, no description of Kol’adarash, no matter how cursory can omit the terrifying scourge that has been its greatest fear and woe. SEWER [[XARADONS|Xaradon]]!! 

Disreputable breeders sell so-called pocket-xaradons to parents for them to give to their children as pets on Livery day. These creatures (which make for atrocious pets) soon grow to be a burden and are unceremoniously tossed down the latrine. Now, these “pocket” xaradons have grown as tall as twelve feet! And stalk the network of sewers beneath the city with utter impunity!! Gobbling up children and pets alike when they have the misfortune to wander next to an improperly fortified drain. 

In this city, there is only one way to be safe and that is to secure for yourself an authentic, genuine ICON OF [[HARPPE|Harppe]]!

//Editor's Note: Sewer Xaradons are a ludicrous yet oddly persistent urban legend of Tedorfell's capitol. It's one that suits me just fine though. The city's sewers are extensive, old, and poorly mapped... unless you know who to talk to, in which case they are a perfect home for thriving "undercity" businesses--the kind that hinge on anonymity and minimal governmental oversight. The more people believe in 12 ft monsters stalking the sewers, the less will come down to bother the dishonest tradesmen who keep the economic wheels of the city greased. ~Gorthan Frim//
