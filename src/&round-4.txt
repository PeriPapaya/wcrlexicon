Welcome back, everyone. Ah, Griz, you're back from the [[Switching City]]--how was your granddaughter's party? Oh excuse me, your //niece//. My terrible apologies. Of //course// you don't look old enough to have grandchildren yet.

Ahem! Right, the articles. It looks like we have a number of corrections and redactions this week, though I'm afraid it has rather the opposite effect that I hoped for. First we have Ratalan's rather aggressive addition's to Caen's chapter on [[Harppe]], which nonetheless rather perfectly encaptures the kinds of conflict we so often seen between our [[Aestrian|Aestrian Pantheon]] and [[Atakkran|Atakkra]] neighbors. Remember, my good sirs, the medium is the message, and yours was most eloquently delivered!

Next we had Dr. Grenada's additions to Miss Raptureridge's essay on the Halcyon Era. Despite some tactless internal commentary (which I will most //certainly// be removing before publication--don't forget who holds the red inkpot, Griz!), I see that he has added a number of additional references to sources to the text, which it was rather lacking in before. Despite myself, I must say I am rather impressed with the effect. Between Velocity's practical prose and Griz's academic experience, your combined efforts seem to have produced a most thorough coverage of the topic. Perhaps you should both take a lesson from each other.

Speaking of, it seems that this Miss Raptureridge has decided to reveal her hidden artistic talents and has drawn up a map for our compendium. (Yes, Lady B, I did //intend// to tell her that we have a royal cartographer whom we normal commission for such things, but she just seemed so excited that I didn't have the heart to tell her to stop.) Going forward, we will continue to add relevant markers to this map, and please report to myself or Velocity to request an addition. 

Finally we have Lady Bartolomea's article on [[Epther the Shrill]], who's inclusion in this history absolutely delights me--regardless of your opinions on the morality of her actions, her boldness certainly inspires. And last but not least, Ser Brius Caen has contributed an entry on force of nature and hand-behind-the-curtain, [[Sakai Lain]]. A fitting tribute, seeing as she was loudest voice in favor of this historical council and had a direct hand in choosing each of us to serve on it. Remember: it always serves one well to flatter your benefactors.

By the way, has //anyone// heard from [[Barti|~Bartifellous Barti]]? There is a stack of missives as high as a walpnur's horn in the mailbox by his office, and at least half of them are from me asking where the hell he's been. He'd better not be off on god-forsaken mountain near [[Elskaer]] chasing more footprints... his absence means we have an odd number of authors on the council, and I'll be damned if I let suspicions of national bias ruin my one shot at paro--I mean, the integrity of this project. Between his "disappearance" and those pesky [[Darkhearts|The Darkhearts]] slipping [[anti-Tedorfellian sentiment|Primaria]] into our documents, I'm beginning to think that perhaps someone... Hm. Forgive a me a weary man's wandering mind, it's probably nothing.
