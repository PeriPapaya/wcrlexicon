# Player: PeriPapaya
# Turn: 6
# Title: &Round 6

Good morning everyone, settle down and pour yourselves a drink--courtesy of our very own Barti, most generously offered in apology for his ostentatious, dilatory, histrionic, and borderline slanderous re-entry into our ranks as the defenders of historical neutrality! Or something like that. Well, everyone drink up, it's five o'clock somewhere! 

Down to business. This week's articles have taken a decidedly artistic turn, with Lady B's succinct piece on the long history of [[Lyrical epic sagas]] and Ratalan's thorough breakdown of the [[Verily the Flowers Burn]] operatic format. Say, this is really //quite// detailed--Ratalan, did you mention having some theater experience yourself, before turning to profiteering? //Ahem//, no you misheard me, I'm sure I said "prophet-eering". Just a little pun, no need to go all angry-[[xaradon|Xaradon]] on me!

...moving on, it looks like Velocity has decided to tackle the [[Heirs of Aegus]] and their role in the emergence of Belar's traditiosn of arts and rulership. Meanwhile, Griz has decided to examine the [[Daunderfel Dynasty]], with it's significant advances in [[zenthite|Zenthite]] technology laying the groundwork for the later rise of the modern Tedorfellian state. Ser Brius has supplied us with some background on the [[Atakkran Church|Atakkra]]--no, Ratalan, //I'm// the only editor here, if you want to dispute any of Caen's claims you will have to issue a formal redaction. Brius, that goes for you too--//put that warhammer down right now!// Gah! I thought I told you to stop bringing weapons to council meetings!

Good grief, where was I... ah right. Our final article is from Barti, who seems to have submitted his travelogue from [[Yvryn]] over the past five weeks. Whoop dee doo, I love my job. Someone pass the decanter.

I think it's time for another round of redactions! You may choose to either write an article in your assigned index... or you may choose to write a redaction on an existing article! **Redactions must not factually contradict the original article**, but they can provide additional information, or recontextualize and question the given information. You are allowed to select articles from any index for a redaction, but you must "claim" that article in the discord so that none are double-picked. You may not write a redaction for a page that you wrote.
