# Title: Oath of the Summer Queen

Even when forgotten, legends and myths don’t die easily. They limp on, living a shadow’s existence in the minds of the people who reenact their ancestor’s echoes as actors mastered by the text, as puppets on the tunes of the past. And nobody escapes this entirely. We are all influenced by the past and even by its currents gone underground. 

Why is it that we used to conclude treaties and accords of all kinds with the letters “SQ” (in vernacular “sequ”)? Because it hearkens back to the Summer Queen’s court. 
At her [[dynasty’s|House Gregari of the Sun Throne]] zenith (its thunderous downfall branded its glow in common memory) all agreements and disputes were to be resolved in the presence of her deputies in lieu of her surveillance. All parties had to voice their agreement by swearing to her: “By the Court of the Summer Queen!” Whether in a shepherd’s shed or at a count’s courtyard, that cry had to rang out.

Through the millennia after the [[Sundering War]], the lower classes kept practicing that custom, quickly and increasingly abbreviated as to not draw their new rulers’ ire. (Sometimes the conflicted church was a safe place, [[sometimes not|Oathkill Heresy]])\\
And now the Queen herself isn’t inspiring political action anymore, the higher classes captured that custom, hoping to borrow some of her glamour to dignify their handlings. 

But now we might be at the threshold of that custom’s death. Even royals practice it less and less, favoring references to their own institutions of authority. It will be interesting to observe under whose auspices the upcoming marriage will be signed off. 


//Editor's Note: Come to think of it, my last few prison sentences were sworn and signed under SQ. If  the Oath is out of fashion, can I get those annulled? ~Gorthan Frim//
