Excuse me, everyone! Order, please! Sir Brius, can you please leave that hammer at the coat check next time? Yes, I know it's part of your research but I'm a convicted felon and they'll suspend my parole if I'm around implements of deadly force. Thank you.

I hereby call to order the first meeting of the Bi-National Council of the Royal Histories. I have received your biographies and it is an honor to be here in such... illustrious company with you all. Goodness: an aristocrat, an academic, a mad prophet, a gym rat, children's author, and a bumpkin mythology enthusiast--and myself a current-con/ex-con, of course. We //are// a ragtag bunch. 

Well. As you know, our job is to take all that warring and whatnot of the past six millenia or so and spin it into something vaguely history-shaped and palatable to the bigwigs cutting our paychecks. Lady Bartolomea, I see that disapproving glare and I am sorry to say it does not intimidate me in the slightest. Hmm? Yes, Truth and Accuracy! It //would// be lovely to include those things in your writings as well, I suppose.

Now, you may have noticed that our panel here is split nicely down the center in terms of nationality, with Lady Bartolomea, Ser Brius, and Ratalan from Tedorfell and Dr. Grenada, Mr. Barti, and Miss Raptureridge representing Belar. Among your... varied backgrounds, the governments of both nations hope that you will be able to balance the each other's biases and find an equitable representations for some of history's more, ah, //contentious// episodes. As your chairperson and lexical editor, I'll be vetting everything that gets put into the book. This involves checking you for historical consistency (once again //accuracy// is optional), palatability, and the absolutely unenviable job of spell-checking you all. Joy of joys.

Hm what's that, Dr. Grenada? My own biases? Oh don't worry about those, I hate both your wretched countries with equal impassion. Ha!

Alright folks, let's get cracking. I want a fresh article on my desk by next Wednesday. Remember that the royal wedding is just around the corner, and until it is sworn in place by Summer Queen's good name this alliance will be as shaky as a one-legged stork on widgenboat. A good story can bring people together, or entrench them deeper in their differences. History is quite literally in your hands!
