# Title: ~Lady Bartolomea Lucretia Cantabella-Everene

**Lady Bartolomea Lucretia Cantabella-Everene, Second Scriveness-General of the Grand Librarium**, is a native of the Tedorfellian capital of [[Kol'adarash]]. Born into a long line of noted leximages, Lady Cantabella-Everene pursued her ancestral work with great zeal and aptitude from adolescence, achieving the full rank of scribe-knight at the unprecedented young age of 23. She has since spent three decades serving with distinction until achieving her current rank, and has thus become a regular fixture in the archives of the Primaria's palace.


Among her many accomplishments during this tenure, Lady Cantabella-Everene is perhaps most well-known for her heroic efforts during the burning of the [[Cloudrift repository|Cloudrift]] at the hands of Belaran saboteurs seventeen years ago. Knowing that documents containing critical intelligence were held in the building, she cast a spell of remembrance and was able to capture all the lost words in her own mind, where she held them for almost twelve hours while aiding in the citadel's defense until sufficient parchment could be provided to re-scribe the knowledge. For this accomplishment, Lady Cantabella-Everene was promoted three ranks and awarded the Silver Shard.

Now semi-retired from active duty, these days the Scriveness-General is largely content to work from her desk, fortifying the abjurations on her favorite tomes and amending the wordcraft of some of the more inflammatory treatises on the Belarans in light of the upcoming unification. While many of her peers whisper their disapproval of the marriage, Lady Cantabella-Everene holds true to the vow that a scribe-knight's own feelings shall never sway their hand.
