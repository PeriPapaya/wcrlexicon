# Title: Yelda Arch

The Yelda Arch makes up part of the Yelda mountain range dividing Belar and Tedorfell. The arch-like shape, believed by many to be a natural rock formation, is also thought to have been blasted into its present form during the [[Daunderfel Dynasty]] by incendiary devices. The Arch is known for its unusual size as well as its shape, spanning the length of the longest bridges in Belar and Tedorfell combined. Though it can support the weight of several people, its uneven surface and lack of guardrails means crossing over the Arch is fraught with danger and not recommended even for seasoned travelers. Far below the arch, however, runs a tributary of the Belar River, and sailing down it is considered a more pleasant and safe commute.

The Yelda Arch trade route between Belar and Tedorfell follows the river under the arch until reaching the Belar Rapids section of the river, which is too dangerous to navigate by boat. At that point the route veers off the river to go through the [[Vermillion Pass]] to connect the two nations. It is the fastest and busiest route between Belar and Tedorfell for the imports and exports of goods between the nations, though less popular for tourism as it is both difficult for inexperienced travelers and not the most scenic.
