# Title: Yelda Arch

The Yelda Arch makes up part of the Yelda mountain range dividing Belar and Tedorfell. The arch-like shape, believed by many to be a natural rock formation, is also thought to have been blasted into its present form during the [[Daunderfel Dynasty]] by incendiary devices. The Arch is known for its unusual size as well as its shape, spanning the length of the longest bridges in Belar and Tedorfell combined. Though it can support the weight of several people, its uneven surface and lack of guardrails means crossing over the Arch is fraught with danger and not recommended even for seasoned travelers. Far below the arch, however, runs a tributary of the Belar River, and sailing down it is considered a more pleasant and safe commute.

The Yelda Arch trade route between Belar and Tedorfell follows the river under the arch until reaching the Belar Rapids section of the river, which is too dangerous to navigate by boat. At that point the route veers off the river to go through the [[Vermillion Pass]] to connect the two nations. It is the fastest and busiest route between Belar and Tedorfell for the imports and exports of goods between the nations, though less popular for tourism as it is both difficult for inexperienced travelers and not the most scenic.

//Editor's Note: One might look at a map and wonder why the this overland route is so heavily preferred over shipping by sea. Historically, both were fraught with danger: the sea routes due to the relentless hard work of [[Grainish|Grain]] pirates (who continued to operate until long after the southern islands were officially annexed and placed under the supervision of Tedorfellian sea sheriffs), and the overland routes by the continual skirmishing that plagues the southern fertile lands even in supposed peacetime. Economists will tell you that the Yelda Arch route provides better access to the landlocked northlands, but I think avoiding seasickness is a major draw as well. ~Gorthan Frim//
