# Title: Granarch Nimble IV

Granarch Nimble IV was born January 23, 6599 Nucaria Mortefen, third heir to the noble House of Mortfen. While her older siblings were groomed to take on the family business it was determined by the family matriarch that young Nucaria would go into the clergy. On her sixth birthday, she was sent to Sm. Osmo’s Seminary in [[Kol'adarash]] where she’d spend her next decade receiving her religious education.

In seminary and her early career, Mortefen failed to distinguish herself as a scholar, speaker, or leader. However, her superiors must have found her in possession of some unique inexplicable quality that would prompt them to quickly promote the Mortfen scion through the ranks of the [[Atakkra]]. church.

In 6651 Mortefen had risen to the role of lith-arc, a position that brought her in direct contact with Granarch Gracious IX several times before his mysterious death. Despite her relative youth after an unusually short conclave, Mortefen was selected to succeed the late artiff (//'artiff' appears to be a needlessly convoluted and archaic title for the Granarch ~G.F.//). There is little evidence to support rumors that her family purchased the position for her. As artiff she chose the name Nimble, in honor of Nimble I whose relaxing of clerical law first allowed the recently heretical Mortefen family to purchase their first noble titles.

As gran'arch, Nimble IV has been marked by controversy. Critics note the holy ee’s (//i.e. the jurisdiction of the Granarch ~G.F.//) fickle politicking between factions during several armed conflicts, the extreme lenience it has shown promoters of the [[Oathkill Heresy]] and the capricious nature with which the church seeks to place itself between the people and the charismatic prophets that the Brham has chosen to deliver Their message. However, claims that the senile artiff has become the puppet of a shadowy cabal of heretical nobles are most likely a fabrication.
