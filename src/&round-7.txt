Everyone grab your seats, and stop giving me that stink eye. I know we're on a schedule here, but it's not my fault if I'm called away on short notice for court-mandated community service. (They had inspecting the new prisons in the capitol for potential security weaknesses--at least they're right that I have the expertise to consult on that.) Fortunately, I just received word that the royal wedding is getting pushed back a few more weeks. Well, fortunate for us trying to finish this lexicon on time. Unfortunate for those poor government scribes trying to rewrite all the tariff agreements and smooth out the political kinks. I don't envy them... there are days when this whole unification business seems to be teetering on a saber's edge.

But to business! We've been adjourned for two weeks but I'm pleased to see that you haven't been slacking. It looks like our articles this week skewed heavily geographical and heavily southern. Miss Raptureridge brings us an articulate account of the [[Yelda Arch]] as a keystone trade route. Lady Cantabella-Everene speaks with appropriate admiration of [[Graefel]], Tedorfell's most famous port city, and Ratalan calls upon his years of living there to tell us about the nation's capitol, [[Kol'adarash]]. Ser Caen meanwhile looks to the southern plains of Belar to tell us about Re'alro, or [["The Switching City"|Switching City]], though hm... Caen, I thought I warned you not to get too personal with the recent history. (And Griz, you may want to review this before it goes to print.) And speaking of recent history, Dr. Grenada has elected to write about a fellow of our ilk: the historian and poet [[Nogriff the Astute]].

One final item... I have taken the liberty of adding my own contribution to the codex this week. Yes, yes, I know we'd all prefer to ignore the embarrassing elephant in the room, but //somebody// needed to take the fall and write about [[The Umbridgement]]. It's a part of our history after all! An embarrassing, messy, regretful part, sure. Did I hate every minute of writing it? Sure! Definitely worth it to watch you all squirm now, though.
