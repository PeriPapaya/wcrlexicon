# Title: Verily the Flowers Burn

Verily the Flowers Burn (Verily for short) is an operatic subgenre that combines biography with popular contemporary poetry. It first arose in Belar during the [[Halcyon Era]] as a way for the Aestrian faithful to pay tribute to their growing [[pantheon|Aestrian Pantheon]]. The format takes its name from a sixth-century tale of the life of Orne. The burning flowers being a reference to her siege of the garden city of [[Tintar]]. 

Although the characters, setting, and songs of Verily operas are highly flexible that is only because they follow an extremely rigid act structure that will be immediately familiar to anyone who has witnessed a single performance:

Every Verily story begins with the Dawn. Following a brief overture, a contralto delivers a monologue that establishes a setting that at its core possesses a central flaw that will provide the conflict the hero will ultimately have to overcome. Often the villain(s) of the play is introduced in this section along with a heaping helping of gore to slake the audience’s bloodlust before they wait through the second and third act.

Nativity may literally be the birth of the hero but is more often about their early life, and how their positive qualities create a clash with the decadent world that surrounds them. Since these sections usually involve younger actors, recitative is often employed to just keep the plot moving along until the diva (or divo) is able to make their appearance in the next act.

In the Rise the hero comes to the height of their understanding and power. They seek to challenge the inequities of the world and the antagonists who profit by them. This section must have no fewer than two soliloquies by the hero, the latter of which often takes the form of a climatic obbligato.

During Destruction the hero's plans are torn asunder by the sinners of the world and their body is ritualistically tortured. During the torture, most shows feature an Aria Martire, a virtuosic solo performance that often ends with a lengthy cadenza.

Finally, in the Ascension, the hero’s suffering is ended when their heroic actions come around to reward them, and they are chosen to sit among the gods, and the entire cast (including the dead) returns for one final ballad.

No doubt at this point astute readers have identified a contradiction. For all the inherently Aestrian qualities of this quintessential Beleran theatre style, it is painfully obvious to anyone with even the faintest familiarity with the [[Atakkra]] that Verily in all its many forms is a mere retelling of the Tempers of Crit. The story of how the Bhram’s 1st incarnation freed [[Pellemere]] from the temple merchants only to be betrayed by her sister and slain. Verily! Belar’s most celebrated addition to the world of theater is naught but a kitschy imitation of The Greatest Story Ever Told!

//Editor's Note: It appears our Ratalan is something of a theater nerd, and a rather traditionalist one at that. I would be remiss to publish this article without an addendum that while Ratalan has accurately recounted the fundamental structure of a Verily opera, in modern times one rarely sees the formula played straight anymore--dramatic twists and genre subversions have been much more the style of recent poet bandits and scribe bards. And I must profess my own doubts at the connection he has drawn to the Tempers. Is the story of straining against one's society not one of the most fundamental forms of dramatic conflict? Morsian knows everyday is a struggle for me in this appointment. ~Gorthan Frim//
