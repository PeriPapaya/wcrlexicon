# Title: Halcyon Era

The Halcyon Era was, as per its name, a peaceful time in this region's history, somewhere around the 400s and 700s. Detailed record keeping of this time period is hard to find after the [[Sundering War]] rained devastation upon all the lands, destroying most documentation of life in Belar and Tedorfell prior to the Wars. 

Nevertheless, some records were preserved in the more remote outposts of the continent that battles failed to reach, such as the archives of [[Pellemere]] in the far south. The Pellemeran library, with four stories underground and two above ground, has been standing securely since recorded history began, and contains many volumes of great historical and literary significance (and has a generous interlibrary lending system allowing citizens all over Belar to borrow or examine its rarer offerings.) This library also happens to hold the earliest known libretto for the opera [[Verily the Flowers Burn]]. Its archives include several scrolls dating back to not just the Halcyon Era, but also the centuries immediately following it, which established the Halcyon Era as the name for this time period.

According to the few surviving contemporary records we have, the Halcyon Era was a time of peace and prosperity for Belarans and Tedorfellians alike, but its stability could also be viewed as a time of stagnation. There was little trade, travel, exploration, or invention as described in the records. Perhaps after centuries of unease and uncertainty, citizens were simply enjoying the luxury of rest.
