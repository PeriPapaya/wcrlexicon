<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>~Velocity Raptureridge</h1><p>Velocity Raptureridge is not an esteemed scholar of anything, really, but what she lacks in credentials she makes up for with enthusiasm and sometimes-terrifying passion for the legendary <a  href="Sundering_War.html">Sundering War</a> period. She lives with her parents in a remote village of Belar and spends her days reading through every book in her local library and the traveling libraries that happen to visit. It is from one such traveling librarian that Velocity learned of this endeavor to compile a new comprehensive encyclopedia of the Belar-Tedorfell union, and jumped at the chance to share her passion with a new audience.</p>
<p>Due to the remoteness of Velocity's village and singlemindedness of her focus, recent history may pass her by, but absolutely no one is more familiar with the (alleged) movements of the Cloudrift army against the Tedorans than Velocity. She's prepared to argue with you until you see her point of view.</p>
<p>She is also highly knowledgeable about the ballads and <a class="phantom" href="Lyrical_epic_sagas.html">lyrical epic sagas</a> written during and about the Sundering Wars, and is looking forward to sharing this information with her fellow encyclopedia compilers.</p>
