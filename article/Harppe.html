<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Harppe</h1><p>Harppe is the God of Mystics, Farseers and Oracles in the <a  href="Aestrian_Pantheon.html">Aestrian Pantheon</a>. Like all Aestrian gods, Harppe is said to have been a legendary mortal before achieving godhood although like many of her peers, there is much doubt as to whether she ever truly lived. The era Harppe was meant to have lived in is unspecified by all official recountings but historical theorists generally agree that she would have existed around the nebulous <a  href="Halcyon_Era.html">Halcyon Era</a>, between the 400th and 700th year of our calendar. Stories tell that she lived in a kingdom called Getele, which does not appear in any other legends or historical records casting additional doubt upon any accuracy her legend may have. Scholars generally agree that if Getele did indeed exist, it would likely have been a part of what we now know as the Isle of Sedgetera.</p>
<p>    The legend of Harppe has her beginnings as a humble soothsayer who had visions of an invasion of Getele by a powerful kingdom of mainlanders. Realizing that even with forewarning her small kingdom lacked the strength to fight off the invasion, she dove deeper into augury, utilizing powerful and dangerous magics now lost to the ken of mortals. She foresaw that the war need end in the ultimate perishment of one of the sides so she undertook a quest to bring about the devastation of the enemy kingdom. At the end of her arduous and intricate quest, the invasion had already been launched but she was able to leverage political forces and arcane artifacts to decimate the kingdom of invaders. When they realized their leadership and supply lines were lost to them, the invaders pled clemency and joined Getele as a subservient class. Harppe was hailed as the greatest of heroes and ascended to godhood shortly after, gaining absolute mastery of augury in the process. The legend ends with her leaving behind numerous icons to be scattered to various locations and found only by pivotal individuals throughout history as part of a great plan of hers for the future of the world. </p>
<p>    Harppe’s legend is unlikely and the legacy her myth engendered has been just as untrustworthy. Many have come forward claiming to trace ancestry back to her but this “blood of oracles” has been notoriously unreliable in truly improving a farseer’s sight or auger’s predictions. Furthermore, “Icons of Harppe” have been fabricated time and again by charlatans seeking the ear of those that hold true power. Such opportunistic pretenders have historically leveraged guesswork, psychology and coincidence to attain influence and more often than not brought about the ruination of those who have heeded them with untrustworthy and selfish advice. Regardless of the truth of Harppe’s legend, her name has been irrevocably tarnished by those who use it for easy credibility, even in the eyes of many Aestrians who often see her as unreliable in the modern era.</p>
