<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Oathkill Heresy</h1><p>The Oathkill Heresy was a low point in interfaith relations. The <a class="phantom" href="Atakkra.html">Atakkra</a> Church had been growing tired of the common man's adherence to the <a  href="Oath_of_the_Summer_Queen.html">Oath of the Summer Queen</a>. It had long been argued by them that if there were oaths to be made it ought to be to the true god, not a dead queen. This was a point of contention between them and the <a  href="Aestrian_Pantheon.html">Aestrian Church</a> who saw no issue with homage to The Sun Queen -who was made a member of their pantheon- and encouraged her oath among their followers. The protestations of the Atakkra Church went largely unheeded even by their own followers much to the chagrin of church officials. This came to a head in 3504 when Granarch Lefold made purchase of 80 acres of farmer Laine Fellow's land.</p>
<p>The agreed upon payment was set to be 30 lucres a month for a year. Fellow insisted on swearing The Queen's Oath to seal the deal in front of the eight witnesses. Lefold reportedly did the same. When it came time to pay, Lefold refused, stating that the oath held no meaning for him and therefore was not binding for him. When Fellow gathered a mob to take his land back by force, Lefold's guards met them and a battle was fought. The guards were killed and Lefold, residing in a manor erected on the land, was taken prisoner and dragged through the streets.</p>
<p>The Atakkra church sent a force of 300 Zealous Pikes, 20 Holy Paladins, and three members of the <a class="phantom" href="Magi_Circles.html">Fiedus Mage Circle</a> to take the town of Kenuch, free the Granarch and punish the heretics. Commoners from other towns came to Kenuch to form a militia reported to be over 800 strong with the intent of driving off the Atakkra force and ultimately denying the church claim to sovereign power outside of their holy edifices. The militia were slaughtered to a man. No prisoners were taken. The holy soldiers then occupied the town, ensuring no aid would come to the orphans and widows of Kenuch for ten days and ten nights as penance for the heresy.</p>
<p>This incident inflamed tensions between the Atakkra and Aestrian churches and even the Atakkra church and its own, less devoted adherents. The Primarch of Tedorfell being a strict Atakkran, Tedorfell almost used this incident to make Atakkra their the national religion. Incredibly, the church of Atakkra talked them out of this decision, fearing for their adherents in Belar should Tedorfell show them overt favor. Sentiments about the incident run deep still and it is a dangerous topic to broach to this day. It is remembered not just as a conflict between two faiths but between a faith's authorities and its masses.</p>
<p><i>The common men met armored force<br>
 'Neath dark and bloody skies<br>
Again they made to rally forth<br>
Though futile were their tries.<br>
Forget ye not, o downtrodden<br>
Just where the power lies<br>
For when you move to take it back's<br>
When everybody dies</i><br>
-From Oathkill by the poet bandit <a  href="Kaedreus.html">Kaedreus</a></p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: It is telling of just how badly the Oathkill Heresy shook the foundations of power at the time to see even a true-blooded Tedorfellian like Ser Caen speak of it in such damning terms. Although I am side-eyeing the enthusiasm with which he describes that display of force sent to Kenuch. Zealous Pikes indeed. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
