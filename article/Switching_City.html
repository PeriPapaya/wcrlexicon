<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Switching City</h1><p>The history of Re'alro, also known as The Switching City is as fascinating as it is rich and far reaching. Of our records of the times before the death of the <a  href="Oath_of_the_Summer_Queen.html">Summer Queen</a>, none are as complete as those of the Stone Archives of Re'alro. The city was first built and named by a people otherwise lost to history who called themselves the Re'alen'at or "People of Stone". Indeed, this civilization seemed to have a deep connection with stone, carving buildings into the rock beneath the earth as well as constructing stone abodes above it. They documented their great writings (mercifully abbreviated) and great doings in stone tablets that they housed withing a massive subterranean archive. When The Summer Queen annexed their land, she allowed them to continue their traditions and so the archive was added to during her reign as well. The Summer Queen's rule was but the first of the changes in power or "switches" the city would experience. During the <a  href="Sundering_War.html">Sundering War</a>, the was captured five separate times by the opposing factions and each battle was documented in the Stone Archive. </p>
<p>In conflicts to come, the city would prove more robust but its nickname stuck and came to be how it is known to most who speak of it, the name Re'alro being used now for mostly official documents because "Switching City" is not an official name. It is now known of course for its treasure trove of an archive but for its important location as a trade checkpoint on the <a  href="Yelda_Arch.html">Yelda Arch</a> trade route, tremendous stone sculptures, fantastic underground Orn mushroom farms and its large, if somewhat checkered university, Eli (From which graduated Granarch Lefold of <a  href="Oathkill_Heresy.html">Oathkill</a> fame as well as a number of other questionable granarchs. It has also in recent years been rocked with faculty overturn and controversy after an <a  href="-Dr._Griz_Grenada.html">expos√©</a> got out of control).</p>
<p>Despite its many controversies, if one is interested in history, Eli is the school to study at for the reasons one may guess.   </p>
<p><i>Editor's Note:  Located in the fertile lowlands of Belar, it is easy to see why Re'alro has been the subject of so many "switches" (such a gentle way to describe conquest!) And for a city that so often changes its colors and allegiances, I can also understand the appeal of carving their records in stone--that kind of permanence is a luxury not available to the city in most other ways. Still, I'm fond of the place, as I have never been a person of much permanence either. ~Gorthan Frim.</i></p>
