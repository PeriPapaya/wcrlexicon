<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>The Writ of Limits</h1><p>In the summer of 3387 Primaria Fotess Axon put down an attempted coup by a cabal of lay magicians. In response, Fotess moved decisively to curtail the organization of so-called free magi by issuing The Writ of Limitation on the Collective Activity of Wytchzards (colloquially known as the Writ of Limits). This law established harsh restrictions on communication and collaboration between magic artisans outside of liturgical settings.</p>
<p>Initially, the writ forbade any direct communication between magic artisans. Over time the rule was relaxed and magicians were allowed to form small non-hierarchical associations, under close observance by church censors and informants. These organizations would come to be known as <a class="phantom" href="Magi_Circles.html">Magi Circles</a>. To this day the writ continues to evolve, new denominations of lay mage (including sympomages and masonocks) have been approved, and under certain conditions, circles may even apply for limited quantities of the holy stone, <a  href="Zenthite.html">Zenthite</a>. </p>
<p>The Writ of Limits has made Tedorfell’s magic industry is the envy of the world. However, claims of decadence and eastern influence within the holy ee have led some to question whether it is time to place the responsibility for enforcement of the writ in new hands.</p>
<p>With the pending union between the kingdoms of Tedorfell and Belar, the Writ of Limits must now be reconciled with Belaran’s much more liberal magic policies. It will be up to <a class="phantom" href="Bethiria_Reynear.html">Lady Bethiria Reynear</a> and her litigaunts to argue for the writ’s continued necessity in the kingdom to come. May Bhram guide her. </p>
