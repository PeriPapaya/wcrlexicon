<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Aestrian Pantheon</h1><p>Scribe's note: <i>This article on religious matters is not intended to slander, defame, or debase neither the faith it describes nor its adherents. It attempts only to provide basic factual information on a nuanced topic.</i></p>
<p>In the harsh and rugged province of Aestria, the nomadic clans have developed a rich oral tradition of storytelling. And no stories do they prize more highly than those of their gods.</p>
<p>Unlike the belief in a distant creator held by the <a class="phantom" href="Atakkra.html">Atakkra</a> church, Aestrian gods are much more human in their depictions. This is because the gods of Aestria were all originally born human, and achieved divinity upon their death through the great deeds they accomplished in their life. In this sense, the Aestrian faith can be considered the ultimate form of hero worship.</p>
<p>As a result of their southward disapora over the centuries, the Aestrian faith has spread across the continent and now is commonplace across both Tedorfell and Belar. The Aestrian pantheon sits side by side with the church of Atakkra as the two largest religious contingents in the continent. With the <a class="phantom" href="Elechon.html">High Elechon</a> known to be a firm adherent of the Aestrian belief and the <a  href="Primaria.html">Primaria</a> traditionally raised in the teachings of Atakkra, one cannot help but wonder how the impending marriage ceremony shall be officiated.</p>
<p>While there is no formal list of Aestrian deities (some reckon there are upwards of 200 gods associated), a few of the more notable figures include:</p>
<p>-<b>Biragg</b>, god of merchants and craftsmen; bought the Golden Throne of Jyr'ran and held it until his death</p>
<p>-<b><a  href="Harppe.html">Harppe</a></b>, goddess of mystics and oracles; single-handedly saved the island of Getele from invasion by mainlanders through her powers of prophecy</p>
<p>-<b>The Moon-child</b>, goddess of hunters and shepherds; united ten rival packs of Belaran direwolves as one and drove the ravenfolk out of Aestria</p>
<p>-<b>Morsian</b>, god of poets and thieves; stole the words of a king straight from his mouth and scattered them to the winds in song</p>
<p>-<b>Orne</b>, goddess of war and peace; commanded armies for both Belar and Tedorfell, and was held in such high esteem by both sides that upon her death an armistice was declared so that the soldiers of both nations could mourn her loss</p>
<p>-<b>The <a  href="Oath_of_the_Summer_Queen.html">Summer Queen</a></b>, goddess of kings and queens; fabled for her peaceful rule over a united continent</p>
<p>-<b>Umber</b>, god of the forge and smiths; forged the seven weapons wielded in battle against the Serpents of C'yeth</p>
<p>-<b>Zorn</b>, god of judgement and law; served as a Grand Justiciar of Belar--renowned for their kindness and honor, they brought the Mad King to court, pronounced him guilty of cruelty against his people and sentenced him to death, then immediately pronounced themself guilty of treason against their king and accepted death as well</p>
