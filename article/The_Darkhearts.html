<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>The Darkhearts</h1><p>As the Bhram tells us in Atakkra 54:74 “Even in the happiest kingdom, there are swine.” So it can be no stain on Tedorfell that it suffers the existence of the secretive ‘revolutionary’ cabal known as the Darkhearts. </p>
<p>The Darkhearts first came to prominence in the 3660s when they gained a reputation for performing impromptu subversive theatre in <a class="phantom" href="Kol27adarash.html">Kol'adarash’s</a> slums. Their performances are said to have been inspired by <a  href="Epther_the_Shrill.html">Epther the Shrill</a>. The fact that they use a crude depiction of her puppet as a signature bears this conjecture out.</p>
<p>Due to the troupe’s secrecy, the name and number of its members cannot be known.
However, their reach from <a class="phantom" href="Grain.html">Grain</a> to <a class="phantom" href="Yvryn.html">Yvryn</a> suggests they are dozens if not hundreds strong. The Darkhearts have consistently claimed that they are a homegrown movement. However, court investigators have uncovered extensive evidence that proves financial ties between these ‘rebels’ and operatives with connections to the Belaran <a class="phantom" href="Elechon.html">High Elechon</a>. Unfortunately, the exact nature of this insidious web cannot be known since the Tedorfellian court has determined that it is necessary to keep the evidence secret.</p>
<p>In the decades since they were formed the nature of The Darkhearts’ art has been mercurial. They have sought to defame the Primaria in verse, prose, graffiti, symphony, and architecture. The trope has even been connected to the <a class="phantom" href="Vermillion_Days_Attacks.html">Vermillion Days Attacks</a>!! Although that connection is only through former members who left the Darkhearts when they became dissatisfied with the trope’s feckless tactics. </p>
<p>The troupe has evolved again in their latest performance. Naught but weeks ago the fools took aim at this very record and sought to sully it with incoherent graffiti (see <a  href="Primaria.html">Primaria</a>). </p>
<p>Zoggot once preyed “‘O Bhram make my enemies ridiculous!”. For Tedorfall that prayer has been answered with an emphatic YES.</p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: Ratalan, Ratalan, can I please get an emphatic NO from you on any more explicit slandering of the High Echalon? I'm already having trouble enough convincing our superiors that the integrity of this project hasn't been compromised by <a  href="-Bartifellous_Barti.html">Barti's</a> ongoing absence and our lack of Belaran representation. Besides, I've known a Darkheart or two in my time, they were very popular at our stand-up nights in prison. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
