<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Halcyon Era</h1><p>The Halcyon Era was, as per its name, a peaceful time in this region's history, somewhere around the 400s and 700s. Detailed record keeping of this time period is hard to find after the <a  href="Sundering_War.html">Sundering War</a> rained devastation upon all the lands, destroying most documentation of life in Belar and Tedorfell prior to the Wars. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, some records were preserved in the more remote outposts of the continent that battles failed to reach, such as the archives of <a class="phantom" href="Pellemere.html">Pellemere</a> in the far south. The Pellemeran library, with four stories underground and two above ground, has been standing securely since recorded history began, and contains many volumes of great historical and literary significance (and has a generous interlibrary lending system allowing citizens all over Belar to borrow or examine its rarer offerings.) This library also happens to hold the earliest known libretto for the opera <a class="phantom" href="Verily_the_Flowers_Burn.html">Verily the Flowers Burn</a>. Its archives include several scrolls dating back to not just the Halcyon Era, but also the centuries immediately following it, which established the Halcyon Era as the name for this time period.</p>
<p>According to the few surviving contemporary records we have, the Halcyon Era was a time of peace and prosperity for Belarans and Tedorfellians alike, but its stability could also be viewed as a time of stagnation. There was little trade, travel, exploration, or invention as described in the records. Perhaps after centuries of unease and uncertainty, citizens were simply enjoying the luxury of rest.</p>
