<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Epther the Shrill</h1><p>Epther of House Fleyn, later to be known as Epther the Shrill, was born in the city of <a  href="Graefel.html">Graefel</a> in the year 2256. The sixth child of a lower noble family, her parents had little in the way of prospects for her and sent her to Tierset Royal Academy where she intended to study Tedorfellian history. However, she quickly ran afoul of the faculty due to her "unorthodox" style of oration involving puppets and magically displacing her voice. </p>
<p>Deemed unworthy of her place in the school, she was expelled, and shortly after was disowned by her family. Undeterred, Epther began traveling across Tedorfell, taking up a variety of teaching positions at lesser institutions under false credentials. While her performance-style method of education made her popular with many students, her less-than-flattering interpretations of Tedorfell's history and its <a  href="Primaria.html">nobility</a> ran her afoul of the authorities on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>Epther the Shrill spent much of her life in poverty, begging on the side of the road and performing with her puppet for what coins passers-by would spare--indeed, Epther's puppet was in many ways her lifeline, as she constructed it herself out of wood, burlap, and repurposed chicken feather. The puppet was described by <a  href="Nogriff_the_Astute.html">one critic</a> as "a deplorable mockery of natural life...vaguely avian in its form, yet utterly without soul. The detestable thing shed a cloud of feathers with every sickening lurch and jerk of its crudely-formed body, which beleaguered many of the stage-hands."</p>
<p>Epther's final performance came when she attempted to insinuate herself as an archmagus of standing among Tedorfell's magistocracy. The other magi, made aware of her exploits, had a contingent of guards ready to arrest her. Epther managed to escape capture, though her beloved puppet was left behind, and she was never seen again in Tedorfell. In absentia, the puppet was put on trial for her numerous crimes in her place. While it is hard to say that justice was truly served on that day, it was reported that many of the barons in attendance took great personal delight in seeing the puppet burned at the stake.</p>
<p>At the time of her presumed death, Epther the Shrill's crimes included:<br>
-eighty-six counts of theft<br>
-seventy-five counts of trespassing<br>
-forty-two counts of instructing youth without a license<br>
-six counts of instructing elderly without a license<br>
-twelve counts of impersonating  member of the clergy<br>
-eight counts of impersonating an archmagus<br>
-two hundred and thirty-three counts of lese-majesty<br>
-three hundred and fifty counts of defacing poultry</p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: Well, well, if it isn't my old friend Epther the Shrill. It's always good to know that someone is going down in history looking worse than yourself. You can't help but admire the old girl. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
