<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Vermillion Pass</h1><p>The Vermillion Pass is a location of great significance, both historical and geographical. It is the largest pass through the Yelda Mountains that form the border between Tedorfell and Belar and thus a major artery of trade between the two nations; the Belaran Minister of Coin, Jordanius Stonefell, once famously dubbed it "the keystone of the <a  href="Yelda_Arch.html">Yelda Arch</a> trade route."</p>
<p>Due to its position, however, it has also been a site of great strife during periods of political tension. As far back as the Sundering Wars the Vermillion Pass was a strategically vital location in military conflict as it controlled all major troop movements between east and west. It was also here that the legendary duel between <a  href="Lyreon_I.html">Lyreon I</a> and <a  href="Heirs_of_Aegus.html">Sita Aegus-daughter</a> was fought and the Sundering War brought to its end, marking the pass as the center point from which the borders of the two nations were drawn.</p>
<p>Over the centuries the Vermillion Pass has continued to be the stage upon which the theater of war has played out all too many times. Indeed, the name of the pass is derived from the massive bloodshed it has seen, enough to stain the very mountains red according to legend. Its most recent brush with conflict was during the <a class="phantom" href="Vermillion_Days_Attacks.html">Vermillion Days Attacks</a>, in which the attempted assassination of Tedorfell's diplomatic entourage was narrowly thwarted. In light of the upcoming marriage, there have been petitions circulated among the nobility of both Tedorfell and Belar to have the name of the pass changed to reflect the new era of unity, though they have failed to gain much traction as of yet.</p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: To any potential fugitives, the Pass is a highly patrolled area, particularly since the infamous attacks mentioned above. Anyone seeking a surreptitious border crossing would do better to brave the foot trails farther north near <a  href="Elskaer.html">Elskaer</a> or bribing a trade ship on the Belar River to the south. (Now how's that for some practical history? No need for this compendium to be entirely useless.) ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
