<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Daunderfel Dynasty</h1><p>Starting off strong with <a class="phantom" href="Illyacquus2C_The_Burnt_Citadel_of.html">an apparent atrocity</a>, the Daunderfel Dynasty was stacked to the brim with willful and domineering rulers. They had a contentious relationship with the mountains enclosing their Daunder region. Their poems constantly complain about the stark tops surpassing their keeps, but they also revered them. (No great surprise if you think of their mountains as gods or kings.)</p>
<p>Because as much the mountains confined the Daunderfels, they also nourished them. With their rushing dust- and stonefells they filled dells with rare and desired materials and showed the way to veins practically pulsing with them. They unlocked several industrial purposes that grew their economy out of the mountains. It gave the world a rarity: a mountain kingdom that actually expands and conquered lower countries, instead of just staying aloof of them. </p>
<p>The most significant of these purposes is the discovery and practice of magic. It was Autaleous Daunderfel's heirs who dug up <a  href="Zenthite.html">Zenthite</a>. Now, they were not the first to discover it, nor to use it. But wishing to maximalize their profits, they subjected the white iron to experiments to boost it as conduit.</p>
<p>Befitting a burgeoning empire, their greatest invention was also their most infamous. In their hands, magic changed from a tool for trifles and chores to an engine of <a  href="Vermillion_Pass.html">great development</a> and most especially warfare with which they could repeat their founder’s tradition of atrocities. </p>
<p>Tedorfell finishing them off when they had shrunk back as a miserable mountain hamlet is probably one of their most worthy deeds. </p>
<p>It was not all warfare that Daunderfel gave us. Their Ice-path is but one of their contributions to <a class="phantom" href="World_Engineering_Works.html">World Engineering Works</a> and saved many that would have perished in seas. Still, their war crimes were one reason the <a  href="Primaria.html">Primaria’s</a> met little opposition when they brought magic under their control. It would take centuries of hard work for magicians to gain enough respect to act in public with their <a class="phantom" href="Magi_Circles.html">Magi Circles</a>.</p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: The moment when Daunder fell (forgive the pun) is often cited as the beginning of modern Tedorfell's status as a true Empire, though it would take some time before the consolidated power over some of the further territories that the rule today, such as <a  href="The_King-Country_Equation.html">Vashel</a> and the southern islands of <a class="phantom" href="Grain.html">Grain</a>. I always found that curious--though Belar traces the roots of its current sovereign all the way back to that fateful duel of the <a  href="Sundering_War.html">Sundering War</a>, Tedorfellian nobility can only claim direct continuity back to this moment. Still, this has not hampered their ability to catch up technologically--thanks in large part to the Zenthite advancements they inherited from Daunderfel. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
