<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Primaria</h1><p>If you are reading this, reader, we are both lucky. Me, because I managed to sneak this in amidst their papers, and you because you get to hear from a suppressed perspective. They say the Primarias are benovelent rulers, guiding us towards prosperity and peace. Bah! Mullbishit!
But what of their history usually so vaguely contextualized in our books, reader? 
Read on.</p>
<p>Much of a heroic tale has been made of Vinesk’ siege in which the first Primaria repelled the invading Count Lymmeria and abolished the Sehi system, making Vinesk one of the first such cities after <a  href="Lyreon_I.html">Lyron and Sita’s death</a> settled <a  href="Sundering_War.html">the Surrending War</a>. And since then, the Primarias have always been the primary defenders of the people against all forces that would enslave us: restrictive religion, crazy Counts, and mad magicians. Prosperity and Peace!</p>
<p>But substitute plunder and war for these slogans and you will find more truth in their history. First of all, Lehan Lesh, the first Primaria, has almost never been once mentioned to be also the local silver-and ironsmith. That is the reason she allied with the rebelling sand- and silver mine bosses who struggled against the count’s regulations. The reason of her abolishing the Sehi, the reason she afterwards granted the industry free reign. </p>
<p>And they embraced it wholeheartedly! Digging in the White Mountains and after they had sapped the materials they set out and subjugated the nearby cities. Forcing those new happy Vineskian citizens to work in the mines. Primaria, protector from enslaving forces!<br>
And after some centuries reigning as a regional power, its hunger grew once again, until it clashed with <a class="phantom" href="Kol27adarash.html">Kol'adarash</a>, magnet of mourning monarchists and dusty magicians. Vinesk conquered it, but in turn got conquered by its monarchistic culture and magics, so we really got the worst of both worlds here: the Tedorfellian empire. The Primaria, no longer a mere figure head as focus of imperialism, became more like the kings of old, though still beholden to the <a class="phantom" href="The_Baronical_Electorate.html">electorate of barons</a>.
Nevertheless they involved themselves in matters of government, such as bringing the practice of magic under their strict regulation. </p>
<p>The nature of their enemies changed too. By flattening them with their forces, they had already defeated most foreign hostility and instead of without was it within their borders that threats crept up: discontented farmers, <a class="phantom" href="House_Gregari_of_the_Sun_Throne.html">Gregarian supporters</a>, emerging <a class="phantom" href="Magi_Circles.html">Magi Circles</a>, heretics of all kinds, upcoming secularism, smugglers (especially of <a  href="Zenthite.html">Zenthite</a>) and revolutionaries, all of them the Primaria’s again and again sought to squash.<br>
And even now, all who strive for freedom finds this Cerberus of the industrial hell on their path. Beware this dog!</p>
<p>Do not be fooled by the Primaria’s pretensions of love or affection for you, reader, she regards you with condescension and fear! Examine her laws and you will come to that realization. Do no longer depend on this state sanctioned pablum, but read the suppressed revolutionary literature! May you and I become free. Long live the <a class="phantom" href="The_Darkhearts.html">Revolution</a>!</p>

<p><i>Editor's Note: Hey wait a second... how did this get in my papers? What is this crack-pottery? Gah, Morsian damn these conspiracy theorists, they're going to get us all fired! I'll have to look into how this ridiculous, asinine, unhistorical clipping could have POSSIBLY gotten mixed up in my official files. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
