<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>King-Country Equation, The</h1><p>As all places, history has its overlooked corners, yet out of which the dust and winds contribute to the house. And one of those corners who have paved the way to the marriage of our esteemed majesties was Esheria, one of world’s first secular political theorists.<br>
Born in the 1780’s and in the developing Tedorfellian eastern seacity <a class="phantom" href="Graefel.html">Graefel</a> she grew up as beloved daughter of the city’s <a  href="Primaria.html">Primaria</a>, Canis Baeni. 
It might have been her gazing northwards at the visions raging through the Cloudrift, or her hearing the far-off thunder of armies marching on the Belarans, or perhaps her pity for her townspeople, but in any case she desired peace.</p>
<p>She studied the world and observed the relationship of the monarch to their country. Indeed, she posed King and Country were metaphysically One. And that if the ills of one side were hard to cure, treating the other side will subsequently heal the other.<br>
This nonsense the palace-fed academics took to like leaking ships to buckets.<br>
It did have good results. Such as the installation of a sewer system after a monarch suffered intermittent diarrhea. And the union of southern countries Vash and Fahel through their rulers’ marriage into Vashel.</p>
<p>However, problems arose when a royal child was born. Esheria insisted this necessitated a change in the country. Eventually a compromise was settled and Vashel committed to creating a great island close to <a class="phantom" href="Graefel.html">Graefel</a>: <a class="phantom" href="Grain.html">Grain</a>.<br>
A consuming task! Which contributed to tensions, which collapsed the Union into civil war. To this day, Grain never got its planned size, but nevertheless managed to grow multiple city-states. And one of them, Absom, birthed the great diplomat, <a  href="Sakai_Lain.html">Sakai</a>, the chief architect of the upcoming marriage. </p>
<p>Which just goes to show the unpredictability of the world.</p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: The connection from creation of Grain to the birth of Absom hundreds of years later seems tenuous at best, but it's exactly the sort of pleasant mullbishit the High Echelon and the Primaria hired us for. Good work. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
