<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Atakkra</h1><p>The Atakkran faith worships a deity known by many names and forms but most holistically as The Brahm. Many sects believe that The Brahm is the god above other gods although the official word from most church heads is that The Brahm is the only deity to exist. The Atakkran mythos is one of numerous tales surrounding a number of prophets but the salient matters are that all preach the teachings of The Brahm. The specificities and indeed occasionally the broader terms of these teachings tend to vary from sect to sect but there are 374 teachings called the Atakkra that are considered immutable. These range from describing good deeds that must be done at least once a year to detailing the proper method of harvesting grain. They are considered, even by most Atakkran scholars to be of varied ethical utility but memorization of all of them is required for consideration in an Atakkran seminary. Atakkran theological elites also speak of 7 secret teachings known as the Esakkra but their mastery and adherence to these teachings is dubious as they are so secret that nobody else knows what they are. </p>
<p>The Atakkran Church's origins are traced back to the <a  href="Halcyon_Era.html">Halcyon Era</a>. The official origin story they provide is that the movement began when Prophet <a class="phantom" href="Xek_Aleman_Datish.html">Xek Aleman Datish</a> received The Atakkra from Brahm and preached them to the masses. Many historians claim the movement actually began when many smaller monotheistic churches came together in hopes of rivaling the then dominant <a  href="Aestrian_Pantheon.html">Aestrian Pantheon</a>. What is known is that for over a thousand years, the church has done an admirable job of consolidating power in both Tedorfell and Belar with influence in both governments and sanctuaries and chapels even up and down the <a class="phantom" href="Yelda_Arch.html">Yelda Arch</a> In Tedorfell, the Atakkran Church is even allowed an army almost as large as the Primaria's own and relatively free reign with it.</p>
<p>The Atakkran Church has used its influence to great benefit for many. Their Atakkra of guardianship has led them to construct and staff orphanages that the years of conflict have unfortunately made badly needed. Their sanctuaries have also sheltered many from criminals or vengeance takers who would seek their lives. Unfortunately, like all powerful organizations, they are not without their corruption. there have been countless scandals of Atakkran mystics not truly being magical, leaving communities without proper arcanites that have been covered up by the church. Their own need to appear infallible has even led to their own detriment at times. It is the policy of the high figures of the church to never admit a holy relic as fabrication once it has been accepted by the church even when the "discoverer" himself has been found guilty as a forger. To an entity for which influence is everything losing face is the greatest blow. It is still not recommended one attempt to confound the church, however. While they may never publicly admit their mistakes, it may be noted that such forgers never seem to live long enough to properly enjoy their success.      </p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: I was cellmates an excommunicated Atakkran priest once. Apparently, the final initation into the 7 Secrets involved getting locked in a dark cave of a temple for a weak until the Brahm appears to whisper them to you in holy communion. When they let you out, they ask you if you know the Secrets (but not what they are) and if you say "Yes", you pass. So my question is--how do we know any of them are following the same Secrets at all?! ~Gorthan Frim.</i></p>
<p><i>P.S. It would be more accurate to say that no <b>known</b> forger has lived long enough to enjoy their success. I assure you some of the uncaught ones are living large. ~G.F.</i></p>
