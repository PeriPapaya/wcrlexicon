<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>~Chairperson Gorthan Frim</h1><p><b>Gorthan Frim</b> is the chairperson of the illustrious panel of historians and leximages commissioned to author the joint history of Belar and Tedorfell. They undertake this task with great reluctance, but thank the rulers of both countries for this generous opportunity to avoid being thrown in jail (again).</p>
<p>Frim has, at various times, claimed to have been born in various towns across Belar and Tedorfell including Rellae, Penny's Hook, Grisht, Tintar, and the Isle of Sedgetera. Neither kingdom will grant them a birth certificate, as doing so would allow them to also claim citizenship, and nobody wants that. </p>
<p>Frim began their career as a secret agent in <a class="phantom" href="Kol27adarash.html">Kol'adarash</a>, the Tedorfellian capitol. However it is unclear which country they were working for, as they promptly betrayed both in a maneuver described by some as "not exactly a quadruple-cross, more like a hyper-cube really" and "dastardly, but not in a cool way." Frim was arrested and jailed, but soon released as he agreed to work as a counter agent for Tedorfell. Upon crossing the border into Belar, they were then arrested in that country as well. They soon cut a similar deal for their subsequent release, which they later also violated.</p>
<p>It is commonly said that Frim holds the record for the highest number of incarcerations in both countries; however, this is untrue, as there are accounts of a <a class="phantom" href="Epther_the_Shrill.html">43rd century Tedorfellian ventriloquist</a> achieving a higher number in her home country. Frim's crimes include, but are not limited to, fraud, swindling, posing as a member of the clergy, espionage, counter-espionage, counter-counter-espionage, double-crossing, double-dealing, double-dipping, and insulting the personal hygiene of the High Echelon in public.</p>
<p>Many wonder how Frim ended up leading such a prestigious project as this. Rumor holds that the bi-national organizing committee were unable to agree on a chairperson from either Tedorfell or Belar, fearing that doing so would introduce political bias into the resulting historical volumes. Frim's appointment was a compromise, as they are hated equally in both nations.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, Frim responded: "The bastards know this project is career suicide. I'm just glad they're letting me out of my cell for a few weeks."</p>
