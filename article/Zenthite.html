<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Zenthite</h1><p>Zenthite is an incredibly rare metal that is prized across the continent for its many unique properties in blacksmithing, architecture, and spellcraft.</p>
<p>While its existence was presumably known earlier (there are records of "a luminous white iron, smooth as glass to the touch yet impenetrable to even the sharpest pick" dating back almost five thousand years), zenthite was not widely studied until the <a class="phantom" href="Daunderfel_Dynasty.html">Daunderfel Era</a>, when advances in geomancy allowed for the substance to be mined in large quantities for the first time.</p>
<p>In addition to being one of the hardest substances found terrestrially, zenthite also has an abnormally high melting point, making it difficult to use for metalworking but incredibly durable when refined. Even more intriguing are its magical applications; zenthite is the most effective conduit for magical energies currently known. Arcane scholars theorize that zenthite possesses the same natural "resonance" as magic, allowing it to channel and direct spells with no loss in potency. Thus, zenthite has seen great demand from many <a class="phantom" href="Magi_Circles.html">Magi Circles</a>: zenthite nibs for the quills of leximages, zenthite staves for symphomage conductors, and other such innovations have allowed for greater achievements in the practice of magic than ever seen before. Weapons made of zenthite are also highly prized, particularly among the warrior clans of Belar, who believe that such weapons are capable of devouring the very souls of those they cut down.</p>
<p>Veins of zenthite have been found in several places, but its greatest abundance in recent years has been in <a class="phantom" href="Grain.html">Grain</a> (some hypothesize that the island was created in a fortuitous location, others that the magical creation of the island somehow induced a supply of the substance into being). That the main supply of zenthite is under <a  href="2ATedorfell.html">Tedorfell</a> control has been no small bone of contention in its relations with Belar.</p>
