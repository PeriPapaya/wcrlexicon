<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Lyreon I</h1><p>Lyreon I is a mythic figure in history. Whether he is a great hero or a great deceiver depends on who is recounting the myth. In the duel between Aegus and Kol'Dar described by esteemed colleague <a  href="-Lady_Bartolomea_Lucretia_Cantabella-Everene.html">Lady BLC-E</a>, Aegus, to the best of the knowledge of historians, made the baffling decision to bring no second or witness to the duel, leaving Lyreon as the sole witness. His testimony placed Kol'Dar on the throne and his failure to produce Aegus' body is cited as one of the reasons this became a war. Whether or not this had been intentional is a secret he took to his grave.</p>
<p>The legends of his actions during that war, while impressive, did little to dispel the suspicions many have that he was all too enthusiastic for the conflict. Lyreon was one of the most impressive warriors in recorded history. It is said that Tedorfell took the vital <a  href="Vermillion_Pass.html">Vermillion Pass</a> solely because Lyreon himself fought hard enough to turn the tide upon his arrival. He was also said to be fairly ruthless in his campaign against the nations that would become Belar and no legend or recording tells of a Belaran ever having been taken prisoner in a battle he participated in. While uncompromising on the battlefield, Lyreon was remembered as an effective ruler off of it, enthusiastically uniting the lands loyal to him and making of them a potent war machine. He built up the capital city to be a bastion that could weather any siege and named it <a  href="Kol27adarash.html">Kol'adarash</a> after his adamant mentor. It never saw a siege but it was said that he spread paintings of its walls far and wide that Belarans might despair at even the thought of assaulting them. </p>
<p>Historians generally agree on these points. His death fighting Sita, one of the <a  href="Heirs_of_Aegus.html">Heirs of Aegus</a> however, was slightly more controversial. While Lyreon was legendary for the scores he slew on the battlefield, Sita is not known in history as a renowned warrior. The first notable record of her in combat was their fateful duel. Her ability to fight Lyreon to a standstill has been theorized about for thousands of years and some have declared foul play. In a time so far removed, one fears that the truth will never be known. Whether seen as a cruel villain or noble victor, Lyreon's legacy is indelible and his name yet synonymous with strength. </p>
