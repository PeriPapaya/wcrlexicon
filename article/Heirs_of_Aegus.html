<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Heirs of Aegus</h1><p>Though the <a  href="Sundering_War.html">Sundering War</a> is often said to have begun when Aegus was killed by Kol'adar in the duel for succession to the throne of the <a  href="Oath_of_the_Summer_Queen.html">Summer Queen</a>, the discontent in the nation did not turn into a war until the Heirs of Aegus took up arms against the new ruler of the continent. Led by Sita, the eldest daughter of Aegus, his seven children became the commanders of the Eastern faction and the founders of Belar as an independent nation-state.</p>
<p>Though Sita is the Heir most commonly spoken about today for her role in ending the Sundering War, the other children of Aegus have also made notable contributions to Belaran history. Second-born child Herago founded the capital city of <a class="phantom" href="Heragorn.html">Heragorn</a>, which became a center of learning, culture and politics on the continent. The third-born and second-eldest daughter Pilaeri, assisted by youngest daughter Illyara, left her role as a military commander early to write political songs and spread her message across the land, becoming the first known <a  href="Lyrical_epic_sagas.html">poet bandit</a> in historical record. Fourth-born Asterloch was renowned for his prowess in battle, such that many believed he would have been a more suitable opponent for <a  href="Lyreon_I.html">Lyreon I</a> in the final duel of the war. And the twins <a class="phantom" href="Festis_and_Questis.html">Festis and Questis</a> were well-known across the continent as entertainers who kept the civilian's spirits up in the face of civil war. Records of some of their original plays and operas have survived to this day.</p>
<p>The literature created by the Heirs speaks to the pain and grief caused by their father's untimely demise, a pain that morphed into vengeance to devastating consequence. Nevertheless, their contributions to the development of Belaran culture will never be forgotten.</p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: I remember being forced to read some of Festis and Questis' plays in school. For such historically significant works, they are surprisingly dirty, and absolutely chock full of inneundo. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
