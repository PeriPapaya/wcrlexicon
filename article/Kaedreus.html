<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Kaedreus</h1><p>Kaedreus was a <a  href="Lyrical_epic_sagas.html">poet bandit</a> active during the time of the <a  href="Oathkill_Heresy.html">Oathkill Heresy</a> when such vocations were at their peak of popularity. Though Tedorfellian in origin, he wandered far and wide across the continent, and pillaged the manors of the wealthy from Graefel to Pellemere to support his vagrant lifestyle.  His style is distinctive for its callbacks to Sundering Wars-era poetic forms and linguistic techniques, rather than the plain, accessible-to-commonfolk speak favored by many of his contemporaries.</p>
<p>As a poet bandit, Kaedreus's work often revolved around the political happenings of his time and other current events. The <a class="phantom" href="Writers_and_Poets_of_Our_Era.html">Writers and Poets of Our Era</a> compendium quotes him as accusing poetry about love of being prosaic and trite, as "the purpose of the poem is to reflect the important truths of the world in words." </p>
<p>This statement caused great debate in the poet bandit community, and it is rumored that Kaedreus's early death at the hands of a band of thieves in <a  href="Elskaer.html">Elskaer</a> was not an unfortunate accident but in fact a deliberately orchestrated act by some of his rivals. The poet bandit Schaerbelus was under investigation for Kaedreus's murder for some time, but the matter was ultimately left unresolved. </p>
<p>Kaedreus's most notable works include his cycle about the Oathkill Heresy and <a  href="Oath_of_the_Summer_Queen.html">the Summer Queen</a> and his long epic lyrical poem detailing the functions and mythologies of the <a  href="Aestrian_Pantheon.html">Aestrian Pantheon</a>. </p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: I've never much liked Kaedreus' verses, they're rather long-winded and bogged down by pop-culture references that are 150 years out of date. And I've had enough of poet bandits as a whole--smug bastards would sell you out for a plea bargain faster than a eulich can quack, it doesn't surprise me at all that one would murder another over a slant rhyme. But that's just my professional opinion. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
