<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Festis and Questis</h1><p>Ah, <b>Festis and Questis</b>! The Bards of Belar! The Singers of the Sundering! The perfect topic for one who has been gently but firmly persuaded to stick to Belaran content and keep editorialising about Tedorfellians to a minimum!</p>
<p>The antics of <b>FesQues</b>, as they are commonly called, started early over a controversy wherein it had emerged that Questis had made use of Festis in order to fake adeptness at teleportation. To avoid a scandal, Aegus was forced to evict the twins from his household. Unfettered, the twins elected to travel across the lands of the Summer Queen on a journey to find themselves. What they found instead were the straw mats and hot soups of many villagers eager to let royalty, no matter how disgraced, stay in their households.</p>
<p>When news broke concerning the slaying of Aegus and impending <a  href="Sundering_War.html">war</a>, FesQues were distraught. While accepted back into the family, the twins had missed the military training <a  href="Heirs_of_Aegus.html">their siblings</a> had undergone. It was thus decided that FesQues was not fight alongside their siblings and would instead continue their travels in the territory that was now calling itself Belar.</p>
<p>The brothers looked in the face of war and laughed. They had accumulated a vast trove of myths and legends from across the region and began the work of molding what they had heard into the plays that would make them the stuff of legends. Before war had even begun, FesQues had finalised their first play, <i>The Glowing Sword</i> and was met with glowing acclaim. The wartorn nation needed a respite, and it found it in <i>The Glowing Sword</i> and the many plays and operas that would come out of their quill in the years to come, such as <i>A Raven's Flight</i>, <i>Grandmother's Old Apron</i> and their magnum opus, the famous <i>Fey</i> Trilogy. Seeing the effect these plays had on the populace's morale, Festis persuaded Herago to hold a yearly celebration during which he and his brother would premiere a new play. To this day the Belar word for a yearly celebration is a questival.</p>
<p>The magic behind a proper FesQues production is that they are crafted in such a way that the entire audience at some point or other is laughing. When the children are not laughing at the physical comedy the adolescents will be laughing at the many double- and occasional triple-entendres, and when neither are laughing the adults will be chortling to themselves at the sophisticated witticisms that were Festis' specialty. This is not to say that each branch of humour is that strictly tailored to each group, indeed there are several reported cases of people being rushed to a medic owing to an inability to breathe from laughing so hard.</p>
<p>Modern reevaluations of FesQues plays have not been kind, owing in part to many differences between what they have written and what little has survived in oral tradition, and in part to the recurring character of <i>Teli the Tedorfellian Dullard</i> which has been deemed insensitive by many who wish to befriend the people of Tedorfell. Nonetheless, FesQues' oeuvres remain a key part of Belar's history; it is said that a country is nothing without its culture, and that culture could not have started without the groundwork laid down by Festis and Questis</p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: Well, Belli, I suppose I should be grateful that you've finally submitted a article that won't get me in trouble with our superiors, but did you have to go so colorful on your descriptions here? We don't have surviving historical sources to back up even half these claims about F&Q's early life, and I <b>know</b> you ripped that story about fake teleportation from <a  href="Kaedreus.html">Schaerbelus'</a> farces on the <a class="phantom" href="Legendary_Epoch.html">Legendary Epoch</a>. Good grief, this is what happens when you let a fanciful novelist write history... grumble... ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
