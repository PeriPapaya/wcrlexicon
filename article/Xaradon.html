<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Xaradon</h1><p>The Xaradon is a large, omnivorous beast that has captured the imagination of both poets, statesmen and generals. Larger, more aggressive and more fearsome in appearance  than a bear, it has been theorized that the Xaradon does not exist naturally, but rather as a result of some long ago tampering with magic before the <a class="phantom" href="Legendary_Epoch.html">Legendary Epoch</a>. Xaradons range from eight to nine feet in height when standing on their hind legs, have thick, dense fur that shields them from injury and keeps water off of them. They have very sharp claws for attacking and climbing as well as serrated tusks for slashing and goring. They commonly eat large fish or hunt medium sized mammals for protein and supplement their diets with small trees. The purpose of eating these trees is hotly debated by scholars. </p>
<p>The first storied use of xaradons in the military was in <a class="phantom" href="The_Sundering_War.html">The Sundering War</a> when <a  href="Lyreon_I.html">Lyreon I</a> was said to have surprised the Belaran forces with a small unit of trained Xaradons at the <a  href="Vermillion_Pass.html">Vermillion Pass</a>. Since tales of Lyreon's demonstration that Xaradons could be trained, militaries from both countries dedicated significant energy to acquiring xaradons for their own forces. Many soldiers have died as a result of these endeavors but the brute force of xaradons seem to make up for the sacrifice in the eyes of military men and the xaradon to this day remains a symbol of military might. On the topic of symbols, Lyreon I also made the Xaradon the symbol of <a class="phantom" href="Kol27adarash.html">Kol'adarash</a> even though the icon of Tedorfell is the kite shield. To this day, the xaradon flies on Kol'adarash flags.</p>
<p> As technology and techniques have improved, the xaradon has seen interest outside the realm of the military. While tough and generally difficult to prepare, xaradon steaks are sworn by as a delicacy for many of the wealthy of both nations. Some individuals have also taken to keeping the creatures as pets. While the writer of this article must caution the reader that acquiring a xaradon as a pet is extremely dangerous and usually inadvisable, he has learned of their loyalty and companionship firsthand and recommends that if one does seek a pet xaradon, it is highly important to focus on establishing a strong rapport as soon as possible. Wrestling is an excellent means for this although admittedly not one that is possible for everyone. That said, the same rule applies for the xaradon as any beast. If there is nobody nearby that could restrain it should it go wild, you ought to reconsider keeping it.    </p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: I once faked an invite to a diplomatic banquet where they were serving xaradon steaks--absolutely heavenly. If you do ever have to wrestle one, I recommend doing so with a rub of lemon and rosemary. If you win it will give you a headstart on the marination process, and if you lose (the far more likely outcome) you'll leave behind a lovely smelling corpse. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
