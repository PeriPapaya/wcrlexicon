<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Lyrical epic sagas</h1><p>Through their centuries of history, both Tedorfell and Belar have accumulated a strong body of literary works. Foremost among these are the lyrical epic sagas; equal parts poetry, opera, and historical treatise, these elaborate works retell the tales of ages long past through the art of rhyme and music.</p>
<p>The writers of these epic sagas come from all walks of life, which often shaped the tone and content of their works. The oldest works surviving in the Belaran style come from none other than <a class="phantom" href="Festis_and_Questis.html">Festis and Questis</a>, the second youngest <a  href="Heirs_of_Aegus.html">Heirs of Aegus</a>, and their older sister Pilaeri is usually credited as beginning the tradition of "poet banditry" though no more than fragments of her works survive to this day. Following in that tradition, the poet bandit <a  href="Kaedreus.html">Kaedreus</a> wrote his seminal work about the <a  href="Oathkill_Heresy.html">Oathkill Heresy</a> from the perspective of a commoner and the great strife suffered as a result. The works of <a class="phantom" href="Nogriff_the_Astute.html">Nogriff the Astute</a>, conversely, place a much greater emphasis on historical accuracy and the intricacies of political machinations inspired by his parallel career within the Belaran government. </p>
<p>While most epic sagas were written with the intention of being performed live, thanks to the magic of leximancy the full experience can be achieved through quiet individual reading. To this day, many leximages work tirelessly to transcribe older works into this new format for the purposes of preservation and ensuring proper enjoyment. Many of these works can be found preserved in the <a class="phantom" href="Cloudrift.html">Cloudrift</a> Repository, from operas written the historically significant style known as <i><a  href="Verily_the_Flowers_Burn.html">Verily the Flowers Burn</a></i> to the controversial <i><a class="phantom" href="The_King_Clad_in_Winter.html">The King Clad in Winter</a></i>.</p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: If you're ever looking for free entertainment, walk into a libracafe and loudly ask about whether the superior saga experience can be found live on stage or in a professionally transcriped leximagical script. Then sit back and enjoy the ensuing chaos as snobs from both sides have a go at each other--it's better drama than you'll find in any libretto. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
