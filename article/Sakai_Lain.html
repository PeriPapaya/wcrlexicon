<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Sakai Lain</h1><p>Sakai was born to the prestigious Lain family in <a  href="King-Country_Equation2C_The.html">Absom</a>, a city-state on the island of <a class="phantom" href="Grain.html">Grain</a>. Her grandfather, Cadeus Lain had risen to the rank of general in the <a  href="Primaria.html">Primaria</a>'s army, winning the Lain family a noble title, one they used to become one of the most influential families on Grain. While her father had been a warhawk her whole life, Sakai believed strongly in the sanctity of life. At the age of 14, she was a union mediator for Absom construction workers and her public speeches on the duty of the strong to the needy won the union paid treatment for injuries sustained on the job, the lack of which had resulted in countless deaths by infection or, when the untreated injuries prevented work, starvation.</p>
<p>She continued as an orator in Absom for five years before traveling at the age of 19 to <a class="phantom" href="Kol27adarash.html">Kol'adarash</a> to see for herself how the rulers of Tedorfell operated. She wrote many papers on the things she learned and the things she thought, becoming increasingly distressed at the death toll caused by what she saw to be "pointless and fruitless bickering". For years, she used her writings, her orations and the influence of her family to leverage change in Kol'adarash and in Tedorfell. She influenced leaders of all sorts from union bosses to <a class="phantom" href="Magi_Circles.html">Magi Circle</a> heads. In time and with age, gentle Sakai even caught the ear of  Primaria Sordani and began to put thoughts of peace and cooperation in her head.</p>
<p>By the time the marriage was proposed outright, she had the backing of twelve noble families and an impressive variety of guilds as well as the trust and friendship of the queen. Even now, she works tirelessly to ensure the union faces no snags, doing all she can to create a spirit of unity between disparate nations, knowing well that such a peace as she dreams of, so dearly won, could be snatched away any time by the slightest of misfortunes.</p>
<p><i>"Prosperity that comes at the expense of others is only borrowing against future misery. Only through cooperation can we thrive."</i><br>
-Sakai Lain</p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: This is a most flattering portrait of Madame Lai, and appropriate to our work seeing as she was key in putting together the funding and support--and yes, also the talent, including yours truly--for this compendium project. Notice how deftly Caen glosses over the finer details of the methods she uses to </i>keep<i> her impressive alliances together. One does not get so much done without being willing to dirty one's hands every now and then. And I don't just say this because of her personal involvement in thirteen of my criminal trial cases. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
