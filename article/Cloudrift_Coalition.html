<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Cloudrift Coalition</h1><p>The Cloudrift Coalition was the name for the loose conglomeration of villages, small towns and cities making up one side of the <a  href="Sundering_War.html">Sundering War</a> conflict opposite the Tedorans. It was named for the Westernmost border of the Coalition, the sheer, high cliff known as the <a class="phantom" href="Cloudrift.html">Cloudrift</a> and marking the banks of the Belar river. The Coalition was notable for not having one single ruler but a council of representatives from each individual city-state, a tradition that persists from the <a class="phantom" href="Legendary_Epoch.html">Legendary Epoch</a> to this day.</p>
<p>The Coalition fell apart during the Sundering Wars due to the highly scattershot and widespread fighting, as each individual town, city and village was forced to fend for itself and could not present a united front against Tedorfell's vast forces. It is this Editor's hope that the union of Belar and Tedorfell will bring back the atmosphere of unity across distance that the Cloudrift Coalition brought to the people in the Legendary Epoch.</p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: Ah, this is a very Belaran version of the tale, presenting Tedorfell as the more unified agressor to Belar's scrappy underdog coalition. For an equality pretty lie, see Lady Cantabella-Everene's take on the <a  href="Sundering_War.html">Sundering War</a>. Perhaps a balance of lies will be just the thing to bring about the feeling of fraternity Miss Raptureridge so desires. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
