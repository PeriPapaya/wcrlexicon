<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>~Bartifellous Barti</h1><p>Bartemis F. Lesaeus, better known by their pen name <b>Bartifellous Barti</b> is a historian and children's author. They are best known for the <i>Barti's Barmy Belar</i> series, a series of scrolls detailling the history and culture of Belar condensed for young readers (with the gruesome and grizzly details kept intact, of course!)</p>
<p>Several years ago, Barti visited an archaeological dig of the Burnt Citadel of Illyacquus in <a class="phantom" href="Elskaer.html">Elskaer</a>, at that time under Tedorfellian occupation. Whilst there, they noticed that the Thatched Sole footprints preserved in the Citadel had a crumbled texture, rather than a solid one. This suggested that the footprints had originated from after Illyacquus had been burnt, rather than before. This detail was of some amusement to Barti, who included it as a footnote (naturally) in their upcoming novel: <i>Scary Elskaerians: Battles and Bathing Habits</i>.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Barti, the footprints in Illyacquus had been used by the Tedorfellians to stake their claim to Elskaer, as Thatched Soles were a uniquely Tedorfellian fashion during the <a class="phantom" href="Pre-Daunderfel_Era.html">Pre-Daunderfel Era</a> that the Citadel dated back from. Upon the publication of <i>Scary Elskaerians</i>, Elskaer erupted in chaos as the still-predominantly-Belaran population rose up against the Tedorfellian Praetoriate, and were soon joined by reinforcements the Belaran forces. By the next Moon, Tedorfell announced the ceding of the territory to Belar, and Barti was lauded as a hero for their part in the scandal of the fresh prints of Belar.</p>
<p>Barti accepted the invitation to write for the encyclopedia with gusto and is eager to teach their new compatriots of former Tedorfell about the rich history of Belar.</p>
