<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Elskaer</h1><p>Elskaer is a province in Belar best known for being the site of <a class="phantom" href="Illyacquus2C_The_Burnt_Citadel_of.html">The Burnt Citadel of Illyacquus</a> from the <a  href="Pre-Daunderfel_Era.html">Pre-Daunderfel Era</a>. Elskaer was under Tedorfellian occupation until several years ago, although now that the kingdoms are uniting the question of ownership over Elskaer is unimportant. It is close to the Belar-Tedorfell border, towards the north.</p>
<p>Ever since the question of the footprints in Illyacquus was resolved thanks to the efforts of <a  href="-Bartifellous_Barti.html">Bartifellous Barti</a>, the site has been a tourist hotspot, selling thatched-sole shoes and matches to curious visitors from across Belar and Tedorfell. </p>
<p>The Belaran Traveling Library network is based out of Elskaer, disseminating books and knowledge around the villages of the country. Due to the recent conflicts and conquests, Elskaer has a highly developed ground transportation network.</p>
<p>Brambleberry buns are an Elskaerian specialty, as brambleberry bushes grow well in ashy soil. The buns can be found in any Elskaerian bakery and taste best with clotted cream. They are this editor's favorite. </p>
