<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>~Dr. Griz Grenada</h1><p>Having lived his youth right in <a class="phantom" href="Tintar.html">Tintar</a>, the westernmost Belar bordering to Tedorfell, <b>Dr. Grenada</b> had the opportunity to witness several invasions and collisions. These were originally frightening to him and as he grew up amidst the strife, he sought to understand war and its origins. 
He started by creating several ant terrariums and subjected them to sociological experiments. This would lead to the first controversies about him. </p>
<p>Rejected by the leading Tedorfellian and the Belarans’ academies who believed the rumors, he found refuge in Eil, the university of the <a class="phantom" href="Switching_City.html">Switching City</a>, where studying Bellogeny he eventually developed his Panbellum theory. His graduation thesis states that all is war, even the instances or institutions that call themselves peaceful. Everything is mired in strife, but morality is still found by arranging the most productive strife and rid ourselves of the most destructive and senseless variants. This met vehement opposition within Eil. When pushed, Dr. Grenada declared even Eil was a place of strife. </p>
<p>Thereupon, in a fit of agitation, the rector ordered him to produce proof within ten days or he would face expulsion. Five days passed by in awaiting silence, then, interrupting the process, a list appeared that revealed multiple scandalous secrets of many esteemed staff members. The subsequent mutual rancor consumed the university such that the deadline passed unnoticed and Dr. Grenada who still had not offered proof graduated. </p>
<p>He then pondered war’s ostensibly opposite theme: peace, and what it constituted and in what conditions it flourished or perished, if it was still war. This resulted in his first book: <i>The Treachery of Treaties</i>. A source of informative discomfort for many diplomats. </p>
<p>Right now, he is working on his second book: an overview of the Switching City’s history and its impact on all of us. </p>
