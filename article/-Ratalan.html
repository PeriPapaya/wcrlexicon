<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>~Ratalan</h1><p>The night <b>Suta Aratelian</b> was conceived his mother dreamed of a luminous bird with one head of a hawk and one head of an eagle. A clear sign that the fetal prince would one day become either a great king or a wise prophet. Determined to prevent the second scenario, the king ensured that young Aratelian grew up with no knowledge of human frailty or religious teachings. </p>
<p>When Aratelian learned the truth he fled his father's house and wandered the wilderness in search of wisdom. He learned to speak to the wind, the trees, and the <a class="phantom" href="Bhram.html">Bhram</a> itself. When he was satisfied he sought his home, but found his father's kingdom had become a forgotten ruin.</p>
<p>And so it was that Aratelian crossed the <a class="phantom" href="Cloudrift.html">Cloudrift</a> to preach to the peasants of <a class="phantom" href="Katthe.html">Katthe</a> where he came to be known as Ratalan. Word quickly spread of his spiritual powers and perfect recall of the 374 <a class="phantom" href="Atakkra.html">Atakkra</a> and the 7 secret Esakkra, despite lurid rumors spread by his enemies. </p>
<p>Ratalan first met the <a class="phantom" href="Primaria-Mother_Jottess.html">Primaria-Mother Jottess</a> in 6656 when he presented her with an Icon of Harppe at The Valsitee. Ratalan shared with her eminence a vision of a jeweled serpent crushed under a red mule's heel and persuaded her to abandon her plans to visit Tribbia. Thanks to his counsel she narrowly avoided <a class="phantom" href="The_Vermilion_Days.html">The Vermilion Days</a> attacks, almost certainly saving her life! </p>
<p>To this day Ratalan remains here eminence's most trusted and loyal advisor.</p>
