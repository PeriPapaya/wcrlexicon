<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Nogriff the Astute</h1><p>It is exceptional that an encyclopedical article be dedicated to someone still alive. Such is the benefit of a long life. The influence of this centenarian is hard to overstate, it has even influenced the very writer of this text.</p>
<p>While Tedorfell has been greatly preoccupied with documenting history – if less so for some disreputable spots of its own – the Belarans took a different approach. History was something to be formalized, to be abstracted into mythology and legends. For example, everyone knows that the famous <a  href="Aestrian_Pantheon.html">ten rival packs of Belaran direwolves</a> as popularized in the play <i>Like wolves howling at the moon fading, we meet!</i> were more likely numbered six.</p>
<p>Well, everyone knows <i>now</i> thanks to Nogriff’s third book: <i>How once again the great swindlers of the Aestrian faith worked their deceivings on the Belaran people and how I, Nogriff Saen, uncovered them. Read this if ye want your eyes cleared!</i> which sent controversial tremors throughout the religious realm.</p>
<p>Even the Attakran church condemned it. That proved prescient when Nogriff’s fifth, seventh and eight books took aim at it. Nogriff by his impatience for the human inclination for self-delusion didn’t care that he left a wake of confusion, anger and fear. There were others, but it was primarily his lyrics that brought on the second wave of secularization, that now rolled through the arts, giving more room for the artists that wanted to make clear contemporary critical art without having to rely on the past for allusions and hints.</p>
<p>Though he didn’t abandon the first wave either, as his parallel career in the Belaran government shows, tirelessly working to force both churches to surrender power to the secular state, which he never really succeeded in.<br>
But now Nogriff’s energy is slowing in his life’s twilight and his burning torch dimming, criticism is starting to creep up. There are claims he went too far in his efforts, that he had a critical misunderstanding of the role of allegory in Belaran plays, that in the end there was little difference between religious and secular zealotry. That by his doing he almost had destroyed religious masterpieces such as <a class="phantom" href="The_King_Clad_in_Winter.html">The King Clad in Winter</a>.</p>
<p>And all of that is more or less true. While in his prime he showed himself to have a more nuanced understanding of art, his approach became uncompromising literalism and as much forbidding as earlier artistical regulations he had fought.  </p>
<p>Still I think there is more to praise than to criticize. He taught his people that power lurks beneath all things and all forms appealing or appalling. He enriched us with tools to dismantle the fanatical mastery that would enslave souls. But I won’t deny that the artist in him had much more to offer for a kinder world than the statesman in him.</p>
<p>And so, quoting both that artist and an great opponent of him, <a  href="-Ratalan.html">Ratalan</a>, I conclude by “bidding adieu to the hero of the wrongfully wrought path” and will “regard even the ancestor’s faults for in them too they teach us.”</p>
<p><i>Editor's Note: Griz, I'm surprised to hear you speak so fondly of the old man. I doubt anyone would accuse your propensity for florid interpretation to contain any "uncompromising literalism". ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
