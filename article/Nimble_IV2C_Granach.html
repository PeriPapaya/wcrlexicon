<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>Nimble IV, Granach</h1><p>Granarch Nimble IV was born January 23, 3599 Nucaria Mortefen, third heir to the noble House of Mortfen. While her older siblings were groomed to take on the family business it was determined by the family matriarch that young Nucaria would go into the clergy. On her sixth birthday, she was sent to Sm. Osmo’s Seminary in <a class="phantom" href="Kol27adarash.html">Kol'adarash</a> where she’d spend her next decade receiving her religious education.</p>
<p>In seminary and her early career, Mortefen failed to distinguish herself as a scholar, speaker, or leader. However, her superiors must have found her in possession of some unique inexplicable quality that would prompt them to quickly promote the Mortfen scion through the ranks of the <a  href="Atakkra.html">Atakkra</a>. church.</p>
<p>In 3651 Mortefen had risen to the role of lith-arc, a position that brought her in direct contact with Granarch Gracious IX several times before his mysterious death. Despite her relative youth after an unusually short conclave, Mortefen was selected to succeed the late artiff (<i>'artiff' appears to be a needlessly convoluted and archaic title for the Granarch ~G.F.</i>). There is little evidence to support rumors that her family purchased the position for her. As artiff she chose the name Nimble, in honor of Nimble I whose relaxing of clerical law first allowed the recently heretical Mortefen family to purchase their first noble titles.</p>
<p>As gran'arch, Nimble IV has been marked by controversy. Critics note the holy ee’s (<i>i.e. the jurisdiction of the Granarch ~G.F.</i>) fickle politicking between factions during several armed conflicts, the extreme lenience it has shown promoters of the <a  href="Oathkill_Heresy.html">Oathkill Heresy</a> and the capricious nature with which the church seeks to place itself between the people and the charismatic prophets that the Brham has chosen to deliver Their message. However, claims that the senile artiff has become the puppet of a shadowy cabal of heretical nobles are most likely a fabrication.</p>
<p><i>Great Gods, Ratalan, cool it with the religious jargon, we're not all enlightened mystics here. And save your attempts at theological slander for the gossip columns and weeknight prayer circles. ~Gorthan Frim</i></p>
