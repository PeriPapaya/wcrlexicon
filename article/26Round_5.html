<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>&Round 5</h1><p><i>Achoo!</i></p>
<p>Excuse me. Welcome back everyone! I'd say it's nice to see you all again but truthfully your eager faces sicken me and I'd rather be back on vacation. That was the most relaxing two weeks I've had in ages, and all it took was a mild stampede of allegedy-paprika-crazed, firecracker-equipped, two-headed euliches running through the building while the Council was in full session! <i>Alledgedly</i>, of course. I've been told that as representatives of both governments we should neither confirm nor deny the involvement of any <a  href="The_Darkhearts.html">splinter groups of political performance artists</a> in administering said spices to the aforementioned flightless birds.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was able to nab all your article submissions before we got thrown out by the profusion of eulich feathers forced us all to evacuate (and my sinuses have been paying for it ever since), so let's review what we have. Ah yes, it looks like Ratalan has, with execllent time, covered the aforementioned <a class="phantom" href="The_Dark_Hearts.html">Dark Hearts</a> for us, though he has somehow made them sound both less <i>and</i> more frightening than I think they merit. They might bill themselves mere performance artists, but between their various attempts to disrupt pre-wedding negotiations and even our own codex project, they clearly make themselves heard in modern politics. And yet... connecting them to the <a class="phantom" href="Vermillion_Days_Attacks.html">Vermillion Days Attacks</a>? Ridiculous!</p>
<p>But I digress. It looks like the rest of our articles cover quite a diverse range of topics. Dr. Grenada's contribution covers the sport and blood of the the <a class="phantom" href="Aegil_Tournament.html">Aegil Tournament</a>, while Velocity is filling in some of our literary history with her exploration of the poet bandit <a  href="Kaedreus.html">Kaedreus</a> and the cultural impacts of his famous works. It is curious to examine these two in juxtaposition, I think, for it seems both countries have some history of working through their political woes through art (of the written or whacking variety.) Meanwhile, Lady B and Sir Caen have both taken a step away from politics, the former with a discussion of the geographically significant <a  href="Vermillion_Pass.html">Vermillion Pass</a> and the latter with one of our continent's most iconic megafauna, the <a  href="Xaradon.html">Xaradon</a>.</p>
<p>Hmm? Do you guys hear someone knocking? Velocity, please be a dear and get the door... By the gods, Bartifellous Barti, where <i>have</i> you been? ... what? You were off investigating a distant tribe that still uses the Julian Calendar? That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. A calendar is still a calendar, so that's no excuse for your articles being late--the rest of you, take note!</p>
<p>Gah, historians! I've had enough of you lot for a lifetime!</p>
