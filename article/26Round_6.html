<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era.</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><h1>&Round 6</h1><p>Good morning everyone, settle down and pour yourselves a drink--courtesy of our very own Barti, most generously offered in apology for his ostentatious, dilatory, histrionic, and borderline slanderous re-entry into our ranks as the defenders of historical neutrality! Or something like that. Well, everyone drink up, it's five o'clock somewhere! </p>
<p>Down to business. This week's articles have taken a decidedly artistic turn, with Lady B's succinct piece on the long history of <a  href="Lyrical_epic_sagas.html">Lyrical epic sagas</a> and Ratalan's thorough breakdown of the <a  href="Verily_the_Flowers_Burn.html">Verily the Flowers Burn</a> operatic format. Say, this is really <i>quite</i> detailed--Ratalan, did you mention having some theater experience yourself, before turning to profiteering? <i>Ahem</i>, no you misheard me, I'm sure I said "prophet-eering". Just a little pun, no need to go all angry-<a  href="Xaradon.html">xaradon</a> on me!</p>
<p>...moving on, it looks like Velocity has decided to tackle the <a  href="Heirs_of_Aegus.html">Heirs of Aegus</a> and their role in the emergence of Belar's traditiosn of arts and rulership. Meanwhile, Griz has decided to examine the <a  href="Daunderfel_Dynasty.html">Daunderfel Dynasty</a>, with it's significant advances in <a  href="Zenthite.html">zenthite</a> technology laying the groundwork for the later rise of the modern Tedorfellian state. Ser Brius has supplied us with some background on the <a  href="Atakkra.html">Atakkran Church</a>--no, Ratalan, <i>I'm</i> the only editor here, if you want to dispute any of Caen's claims you will have to issue a formal redaction. Brius, that goes for you too--<i>put that warhammer down right now!</i> Gah! I thought I told you to stop bringing weapons to council meetings!</p>
<p>Good grief, where was I... ah right. Our final article is from Barti, who seems to have submitted his travelogue from <a  href="Yvryn.html">Yvryn</a> over the past five weeks. Whoop dee doo, I love my job. Someone pass the decanter.</p>

<p>Your assigned indices are: Masha (WXYZ), Vmunroe (DEF), Machina (PQRS), Desa (MNO), Psych (JKL), Kiki (GHI)</p>
<p>I think it's time for another round of redactions! You may choose to either write an article in your assigned index... or you may choose to write a redaction on an existing article! <b>Redactions must not factually contradict the original article</b>, but they can provide additional information, or recontextualize and question the given information. You are allowed to select articles from any index for a redaction, but you must "claim" that article in the discord so that none are double-picked. You may not write a redaction for a page that you wrote.</p>
