<p><i>The upcoming marriage of Grandula, High Elechon of the Belarans, and Sordani, Primaria of Tedorfell, will set aside centuries of strife to unite their kingdoms, establishing a new era of peace and allyship from Witchling Falls to the distant borders of the Cloudrift. In honor of this momentous occasion, the royal chronographer Sylphis Hedera has commissioned a new encyclopedia to record the joint history of their two kingdoms. They have assembled scholars and leximages from both kingdoms to put aside their differences and collaborate on a definitive historical account, starting from the mythical events of the Sundering Wars to the modern era</i></p>

# Player: PN
# Turn: 1
# Title: Example page

This is an example page.
Some words are //italicized//,
and some words are **bolded**.
All of these sentences are part of the same
paragraph.

This is a new paragraph.\\
Unlike the last paragraph, this line will be after a
line break within the paragraph.

This is an [[example citation|Phantom page]]. You can
also cite a [[phantom page]] with just the title.

<p>Each turn, fill out the header with your player information, the  current
	turn, and the title of your entry. The <i>Player</i> field can be anything
	as long as it's the same for all articles you write (even when they're by
	different characters). Using your initials is recommended.</p>
<p>Two line breaks begins a new paragraph. A single line break does nothing,
	unless the line is ended by a double backslash (\\).</p>
<p>Text bounded by ** will be bolded: **bold** produces <b>bold</b>. Text
	bounded by // will be italicized: //italics// produces <i>italics</i>.</p>
<p>To cite another Lexicon entry, use double brackets. Text in double brackets
	will cite and link to the entry of the same name: [[Example page]] produces
	<a href="Example_page.html" class="phantom">Example page</a>. Text in
	double brackets split with a | will alias the link as the left text and
	link to the entry with the name of the right text: [[this text|Example page]]
	produces <a href="Example_page.html" class="phantom">this text</a>. <b>You
		must be precise in the entry title you cite to.</b> Citations to
		"Example" vs. "The Example" will point to different entries and create
		different phantoms, and your GM will probably have to clean up after
		you.</p>
<p>Beginning a paragraph with ~ will right-align it and place a horizontal line
	above it. Use this for signing your entry with your scholar's name.</p>
